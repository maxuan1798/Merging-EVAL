Since locations sizes are going to be big, a game designer wants to have a tool for quick filling of a field part with identical enemy units. This action will look like following: a game designer will select a rectangular area on the map, and each cell whose center belongs to the selected rectangle will be filled with the enemy unit.\n\nMore formally, if a game designer selected cells having coordinates (x1, y1) and (x2, y2), where x1 ≤ x2 and y1 ≤ y2, then all cells having center coordinates (x, y) such that x1 ≤ x ≤ x2 and y1 ≤ y ≤ y2 will be filled. Orthogonal coordinates system is set up so that one of cell sides is parallel to OX axis, all hexagon centers have integer coordinates and for each integer x there are cells having center with such x coordinate and for each integer y there are cells having center with such y coordinate. It is guaranteed that difference x2 - x1 is divisible by 2.\n\nWorking on the problem Petya decided that before painting selected units he wants to output number of units that will be painted on the map.\n\nHelp him implement counting of these units before painting.\n\nExecution time limit: 0.5 seconds\nMemory limit: 64.0 MB\n\n## Input Format\nThe only line of input contains four integers x1, y1, x2, y2 ( - 109 ≤ x1 ≤ x2 ≤ 109,  - 109 ≤ y1 ≤ y2 ≤ 109) — the coordinates of the centers of two cells.\n\n## Output Format\nOutput one integer — the number of cells to be filled.\n\n## Examples\n```input\n1 1 5 5\n```\n```output\n13\n```\n\n",

Each card has a number written on it; number ai is written on the i-th card in the deck.\n\nAfter receiving the deck and the magic number, Vova removes x (possibly x = 0) cards from the top of the deck, y (possibly y = 0) cards from the bottom of the deck, and the rest of the deck is his new deck (Vova has to leave at least one card in the deck after removing cards). So Vova's new deck actually contains cards x + 1, x + 2, ... n - y - 1, n - y from the original deck.\n\nVova's new deck is considered valid iff the product of all numbers written on the cards in his new deck is divisible by k.

Therefore, for each cell of the chessboard, you can assign the coordinates $$$(r,c)$$$, where $$$r$$$ is the number of the row, and $$$c$$$ is the number of the column.\n\nThe white king has been sitting in a cell with $$$(1,1)$$$ coordinates for a thousand years, while the black king has been sitting in a cell with $$$(n,n)$$$ coordinates. They would have sat like that further, but suddenly a beautiful coin fell on the cell with coordinates $$$(x,y)$$$...\n\nEach of the monarchs wanted to get it, so they decided to arrange a race according to slightly changed chess rules:\n\nAs in chess, the white king makes the first move, the black king makes the second one, the white king makes the third one, and so on. However, in this problem, kings can stand in adjacent cells or even in the same cell at the same time.\n\nThe player who reaches the coin first will win, that is to say, the player who reaches the cell with the coordinates $$$(x,y)$$$ first will win.\n\nLet's recall that the king is such a chess piece that can move one cell in all directions, that is, if the king is in the $$$(a,b)$$$ cell, then in one move he can move from $$$(a,b)$$$ to the cells $$$(a + 1,b)$$$, $$$(a - 1,b)$$$, $$$(a,b + 1)$$$, $$$(a,b - 1)$$$, $$$(a + 1,b - 1)$$$, $$$(a + 1,b + 1)$$$, $$$(a - 1,b - 1)$$$, or $$$(a - 1,b + 1)$$$. Going outside of the field is prohibited.\n\nDetermine the color of the king, who will reach the cell with the coordinates $$$(x,y)$$$ first, if the white king moves first.\n\n## Constraints\nTime limit per test: 1.0 seconds\nMemory limit per test: 256.0 megabytes\n\n## Input Format\nThe first line contains a single integer $$$n$$$ ($$$2 \\le n \\le 10^{18}$$$) — the length of the side of the chess field.\n\nThe second line contains two integers $$$x$$$ and $$$y$$$ ($$$1 \\le x,y \\le n$$$) — coordinates of the cell, where the coin fell.\n\n## Output Format\nIn a single line print the answer \"White\" (without quotes), if the white king will win, or \"Black\" (without quotes), if the black king will win.\n\nYou can print each letter in any case (upper or lower).\n\n## Examples\n```input\n4\n2 3\n```\n```output\nWhite\n```\n-----\n```input\n5\n3 5\n```\n```output\nBlack\n```\n-----\n```input\n2\n2 2\n```\n```output\nBlack\n```\n\n## Note\nAn example of the race from the first sample where both the white king and the black king move optimally:\n\n1. The white king moves from the cell $$$(1,1)$$$ into the cell $$$(2,2)$$$.\n2. The black king moves form the cell $$$(4,4)$$$ into the cell $$$(3,3)$$$.\n3. The white king moves from the cell $$$(2,2)$$$ into the cell $$$(2,3)$$$. This is cell containing the coin, so the white king wins.\n\nAn example of the race from the second sample where both the white king and the black king move optimally:\n\n1. The white king moves from the cell $$$(1,1)$$$ into the cell $$$(2,2)$$$.\n2. The black king moves form the cell $$$(5,5)$$$ into the cell $$$(4,4)$$$.\n3. The white king moves from the cell $$$(2,2)$$$ into the cell $$$(3,3)$$$.\n4. The black king moves from the cell $$$(4,4)$$$ into the cell $$$(3,5)$$$. This is the cell, where the coin fell, so the black king wins.\n\nIn the third example, the coin fell in the starting cell of the black king, so the black king immediately wins.\n\n## Editorial\nLet's find the minimum time needed for the white king to reach the coin.\nIt is obvious that it is always optimal to move only towards the coin. In case of white king it means that we should move only up, right or up-right diagonally. During one move we can only add $$$1$$$ or $$$0$$$ to any of our coordinates (or to both of them), it means that the length of the optimal path can not be smaller than $$$max(x-1,y-1)$$$.\nLet's show that we can reach the coin with $$$max(x-1,y-1)$$$ moves.\nFirst step. Let $$$z$$$ be equal to $$$min(x,y)$$$. The king does $$$z-1$$$ up-right moves, so after that the king will be in the cell $$$(z,z)$$$.\nSecond step. Let's assume that $$$x \\le y$$$ (the case when $$$x > y$$$ is proved in a similar way). So $$$z = x$$$. It means that the king is in the cell $$$(x,x)$$$. Now the king can do $$$y-x$$$ up moves, after which he would be in the cell $$$(x,y)$$$.\nIt took him $$$(x-1)+(y-x)=y-1$$$ moves to reach the coin. If $$$x$$$ was greater than $$$y$$$ he would need $$$x-1$$$ moves (could be proved the same way).\nSo now we proved that it takes $$$max(x-1,y-1)$$$ moves for the white king to reach the coin.\nIn the same way we can prove that it takes $$$max(n-x,n-y)$$$ steps for the black king to reach the coin.\nThe king, which is closer to the coin, wins. If the distances is equal, than the white king wins, because he moves first.\nFinal description of the algorithm:\nIf $$$max(n-x,n-y)<max(x-1,y-1)$$$ then the answer is \"Black\", otherwise the answer is \"White\".\nIt is also can be proven that instead of comparing minimal distances between the coin and the kings we can compare manhattan distances between them. I will leave the proof as homework task.\n",

If there is a valid strategy to fit the constraint, doing the same strategy for every maximum number of passengers in the same carriage that is greater than $$$Z$$$ is also possible. Hence, we can try to find the answer by doing binary search the answer.\nNote that a passenger from carriage $$$i$$$ can move to carriage $$$j$$$ as long as $$$i-D_i \\leq j \\leq i+D_i$$$.

We take the passengers until the current destination carriage reaches $$$Z$$$ passengers or there are no more segments to take from.\nIf there exists a non-empty segment of an initial carriage that cannot donate its passengers anywhere, then it is impossible.\nWe can do something like line sweep and prioritise the segments based on their right endpoints using priority queue or other data structures.\nTime complexity: $$$O(N\\log N\\log\\max(A))$$$\n",

      "output": "To solve this problem, we need to construct a permutation of integers such that it reduces to a single element `n` after exactly `k` operations. If such a permutation is not possible, we should return `-1`.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Understanding the Operations**: Each operation removes elements that are smaller than at least one neighbor. This process continues until only the maximum element `n` remains.\n2. **Constructing the Permutation**: The key is to create a permutation where each step removes a layer of elements, ensuring exactly `k` steps. The permutation is constructed by placing elements around `n` in such a way that each subsequent layer of elements is removed in the next step.\n3. **Layering Technique**: We start with `n` and then add elements alternately to the left and right in decreasing order. This ensures that each layer of elements will be removed in subsequent steps, achieving the required number of operations `k`.\n\n### Solution Code\n```cpp\n#include <bits/stdc++.h>\n\nusing namespace std;\n\nvector<int> construct_permutation(int n, int k) {\n    vector<int> res;\n    res.push_back(n);\n    int current = n - 1;\n    for (int step = 1; step <= k; ++step) {\n        if (step % 2 == 1) {\n            res.insert(res.begin(), current--);\n            if (current <= 0) break;\n            res.push_back(current--);\n        } else {\n            res.push_back(current--);\n            if (current <= 0) break;\n            res.insert(res.begin(), current--);\n        }\n        if (current <= 0) break;\n    }\n    for (int i = current; i >= 1; --i) {\n        res.insert(res.begin(), i);\n    }\n    if (res.size() != n) return {};\n    set<int> s(res.begin(), res.end());\n    if (s.size() != n || *s.rbegin() != n || *s.begin() != 1) return {};\n    return res;\n}\n\nint main() {\n    int t;\n    cin >> t;\n    while (t--) {\n        int n, k;\n        cin >> n >> k;\n        if (k >= n) {\n            cout << \"-1\\n\";\n            continue;\n        }\n        vector<int> perm = construct_permutation(n, k);\n        if (perm.empty()) {\n            cout << \"-1\\n\";\n        } else {\n            for (int x : perm) {\n                cout << x << ' ';\n            }\n            cout << '\\n';\n        }\n    }\n    return 0;\n}\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Constructing the Permutation**: The permutation starts with the maximum element `n`. For each step from 1 to `k`, elements are alternately added to the left and right of the current permutation in decreasing order. This ensures that each subsequent step removes these elements.\n2. **Validation**: After constructing the permutation, we check if it contains all elements from 1 to `n` exactly once. If the permutation is valid, it is printed; otherwise, `-1` is returned.\n3. **Handling Edge Cases**: If `k` is greater than or equal to `n`, it is impossible to form such a permutation, so we immediately return `-1`.\n\nThis approach ensures that the permutation is constructed in a way that each layer of elements is removed in the subsequent steps, achieving the exact number of operations `k`.",

There is only one part of the optimization still unfinished.\n\nIt is well known that the Floyd-Warshall algorithm takes a graph with $$$n$$$ nodes and exactly one edge between each pair of nodes. The scientists have this graph, what is more, they have directed each edge in one of the two possible directions.\n\nTo optimize the algorithm, exactly $$$m$$$ edges are colored in pink color and all the rest are colored in green. You know the direction of all $$$m$$$ pink edges, but the direction of green edges is unknown to you. In one query you can ask the scientists about the direction of exactly one green edge, however, you can perform at most $$$2 \\cdot n$$$ such queries.\n\nYour task is to find the node from which every other node can be reached by a path consisting of edges of same color. Be aware that the scientists may have lied that they had fixed the direction of all edges beforehand, so their answers may depend on your queries.\n\n## Constraints\nTime limit per test: 4.0 seconds\nMemory limit per test: 256.0 megabytes\n\n## Input Format\nThe first line contains two integers $$$n$$$ and $$$m$$$ ($$$1 \\le n \\le 100\\,000$$$, $$$0 \\le m \\le 100\\,000$$$) — the number of nodes and the number of pink edges.\n\nThe next $$$m$$$ lines describe the pink edges, the $$$i$$$-th of these lines contains two integers $$$u_i$$$, $$$v_i$$$ ($$$1 \\le u_i, v_i \\le n$$$, $$$u_i \\ne v_i$$$) — the start and the end of the $$$i$$$-th pink edge. It is guaranteed, that all unordered pairs $$$(u_i, v_i)$$$ are distinct.\n\n## Output Format\nWhen you found the answer, print \"!\" and the number of the node from which every other node can be reached by a single-colored path.\n\n## Examples\n```input\n4 2\n1 2\n3 4\n0\n1\n1\n```\n```output\n? 1 3\n? 4 2\n? 3 2\n! 3\n```\n\n## Note\nIn the example above the answer for the query \"? 1 3\" is 0, so the edge is directed from 3 to 1. The answer for the query \"? 4 2\" is 1, so the edge is directed from 4 to 2. The answer for the query \"? 3 2\" is 1, so the edge is directed from 3 to 2. So there are green paths from node 3 to nodes 1 and 2 and there is a pink path from node 3 to node 4.\n\n## Editorial\nFirst let's assume that graph has only the green edges and we still don't know their directions. Then we can do the following. We will keep some node which we will call the \"top node\" and the list of the nodes, that can be reached from the top node. Let's take some node $$$A$$$ which is not reachable and ask about the direction of edge between the top node and $$$A$$$. If the edge goes from top node to $$$A$$$, then we can add $$$A$$$ to the list of reachable nodes and the size of the list will increase by one. If the edge goes from $$$A$$$ to the top node, then we can call $$$A$$$ the new top node, and as the old top node was reachable from $$$A$$$, the list of reachable nodes will remain the same, but the node $$$A$$$ is reachable from itself, so it also will be added to the list. This way after each query we will increase the number of reachable nodes and in $$$n - 1$$$ query we will get the answer.\nIn our graph we have edges that are coloured in pink, so if we will repeat the described above algorithm, we may get that the edge between top node and $$$A$$$ is coloured in pink. To avoid it, let's create the condensation of pink graph (condensation means the graph of the strongly connected components (later SCC)). As it is a condensation, there always should be some SCCs, that have no incoming edges. Let's call them free SCCs. We will pick some free SCC and pick some node from it and make it top node. Now we will repeat the following: if there are no other free SCC except the one, that contains the top node, all others are reachable from the only free SCC, which means that we have solved the problem. If there is any other top SCC, let's pick some node $$$A$$$ from it. Because this SCC has no incoming edges, the edge between $$$A$$$ and top node is green. So we can repeat the algorithm described above. After that as the node $$$A$$$ is reachable by green color, we can assume that this node is deleted. If it was the last node in it's SCC, we delete this SCC as well and delete all outcoming edges from it. Now some more SCCs may become free. And then we repeat our algorithm. After at most $$$n-1$$$ steps all nodes will be reachable from top one by single coloured path, which means that we have solved the problem.\nIn out algorithm we need first to create condensation of the graph, which can be done in $$$O(n + m)$$$ time, then we need to remember how many nodes are in each SCC and keep a set of all free SCCs. That can also be done in $$$O(n + m)$$$ time.\n",

The answer is \"YES\" as you can choose the path from the root $$$1$$$ to the vertex $$$u=10$$$. Then vertices $$$[3, 9, 10]$$$ belong to the path from $$$1$$$ to $$$10$$$ and the vertex $$$8$$$ has distance $$$1$$$ to the vertex $$$7$$$ which also belongs to this path.\n\nThe second query is $$$[2, 4, 6]$$$. The answer is \"YES\" as you can choose the path to the vertex $$$u=2$$$. Then the vertex $$$4$$$ has distance $$$1$$$ to the vertex $$$1$$$ which belongs to this path and the vertex $$$6$$$ has distance $$$1$$$ to the vertex $$$2$$$ which belongs to this path.\n\nThe third query is $$$[2, 1, 5]$$$.

The answer is \"YES\" as you can choose the path to the vertex $$$u=9$$$ so vertices $$$2$$$ and $$$4$$$ both have distance $$$1$$$ to the vertex $$$1$$$ which belongs to this path and the vertex $$$8$$$ has distance $$$1$$$ to the vertex $$$7$$$ which belongs to this path.\n\nThe fifth and the sixth queries both have answer \"NO\" because you cannot choose suitable vertex $$$u$$$.\n\n## Editorial\nFirstly, let's choose some deepest (farthest from the root) vertex $$$fv$$$ in the query (among all such vertices we can choose any). It is obvious that every vertex in the query should either belong to the path from the root to $$$fv$$$ or the distance to some vertex of this path should be at most one. Now there are two ways: write some LCA algorithms and other hard stuff which is unnecessary in this problem or write about $$$15$$$ lines of code and solve the problem.\nLet's take every non-root vertex (except $$$fv$$$) and replace it with its parent. So, what's next? Now the answer is \"YES\" if each vertex (after transformation) belongs to the path from root to $$$fv$$$. Now we just need to check if it is true.\nWe can do this using the very standard technique: firstly, let's run dfs from the root and calculate for each vertex the first time we visited it ($$$tin$$$) and the last time we visited it ($$$tout$$$).\nWe can do this using the following code:\nInitially, $$$T$$$ equals zero. Now we have a beautiful structure giving us so much information about the tree. Consider all segments $$$[tin_v; tout_v]$$$. We can see that there is no pair of intersecting segments. The pair of segments $$$[tin_v; tout_v]$$$ and $$$[tin_u; tout_u]$$$ is either non-intersecting at all or one segment lies inside the other one. The second beautiful fact is that for each vertex $$$u$$$ in the subtree of $$$v$$$ the segment $$$[tin_u; tout_u]$$$ lies inside the segment $$$[tin_v; tout_v]$$$.\nSo, we can check if one vertex is the parent of the other: the vertex $$$v$$$ is the parent of the vertex $$$u$$$ if and only if $$$tin_v \\le tin_u$$$ and $$$tout_u \\le tout_v$$$ (the vertex is the parent of itself).\nHow do we check if the vertex $$$u$$$ lies on the path from the root to the vertex $$$fv$$$?

In this task, a simplified one-dimensional model of this game is used.\n\nImagine an infinite checkered stripe, the cells of which are numbered sequentially with integers. Some cells of the strip have monsters, other cells of the strip are empty. All monsters are made of pudding, so if there are two monsters in the neighboring cells, they stick to each other (literally). Similarly, if several monsters are on consecutive cells, they all stick together in one block of monsters. We will call the stuck together monsters a block of monsters. A detached monster, not stuck to anyone else, is also considered a block.\n\nIn one move, the player can take any block of monsters and with a movement of his hand throw it to the left or to the right. The selected monsters will slide on until they hit some other monster (or a block of monsters).\n\nFor example, if a strip has three monsters in cells 1, 4 and 5, then there are only four possible moves: to send a monster in cell 1 to minus infinity, send the block of monsters in cells 4 and 5 to plus infinity, throw monster 1 to the right (it will stop in cell 3), throw a block of monsters in cells 4 and 5 to the left (they will stop in cells 2 and 3).\n\nSome cells on the strip are marked with stars. These are the special cells. The goal of the game is to make the largest possible number of special cells have monsters on them.\n\nYou are given the numbers of the special cells on a strip as well as the initial position of all monsters. What is the maximum number of special cells that will contain monsters in the optimal game?\n\n## Constraints\nTime limit per test: 5.0 seconds\nMemory limit per test: 256.0 megabytes\n\n## Input Format\nThe first line contains two integers n and m (1 ≤ n ≤ 105; 1 ≤ m ≤ 2000) — the number of monsters on the strip and the number of special cells.\n\nThe second line contains n distinct integers — the numbers of the cells with monsters, then the third line contains m distinct integers — the numbers of the special cells. It is guaranteed that all the numbers of the cells are positive integers not exceeding 2·105.\n\n## Output Format\nPrint a single integer — the maximum number of special cells that will contain monsters in the optimal game.\n\n## Examples\n```input\n3 2\n1 3 5\n2 4\n```\n```output\n2\n```\n-----\n```input\n4 2\n1 3 4 6\n2 5\n```\n```output\n2\n```\n-----\n```input\n4 2\n1 8 4 5\n7 2\n```\n```output\n1\n```\n",

The $$$i$$$-th arc goes from the vertex $$$x_i$$$ to the vertex $$$y_i$$$, has capacity $$$c_i$$$ and weight $$$w_i$$$. No arc goes into the vertex $$$1$$$, and no arc goes from the vertex $$$n$$$. There are no cycles of negative weight in the graph (it is impossible to travel from any vertex to itself in such a way that the total weight of all arcs you go through is negative).\n\nYou have to assign each arc a flow (an integer between $$$0$$$ and its capacity, inclusive). For every vertex except $$$1$$$ and $$$n$$$, the total flow on the arcs going to this vertex must be equal to the total flow on the arcs going from that vertex. Let the flow on the $$$i$$$-th arc be $$$f_i$$$, then the cost of the flow is equal to $$$\\sum \\limits_{i = 1}^{m} f_i w_i$$$. You have to find a flow which minimizes the cost.\n\nSounds classical, right? Well, we have some additional constraints on the flow on every edge:\n\n- if $$$c_i$$$ is even, $$$f_i$$$ must be even;\n- if $$$c_i$$$ is odd, $$$f_i$$$ must be odd.\n\nCan you solve this problem?\n\n## Constraints\nTime limit per test: 4.0 seconds\nMemory limit per test: 512.0 megabytes\n\n## Input Format\nThe first line contains two integers $$$n$$$ and $$$m$$$ ($$$2 \\le n \\le 100$$$; $$$1 \\le m \\le 200$$$).\n\nThen $$$m$$$ lines follow.

These integers describe the $$$i$$$-th arc.\n\nAdditional constraints on the input:\n\n- there are no negative cycles in the graph.\n\n## Output Format\nIf a flow satisfying all of the constraints does not exist, print Impossible.\n\nOtherwise, print two lines:\n\n- the first line should contain one word Possible;\n- the second line should contain $$$m$$$ integers $$$f_1, f_2, \\dots, f_m$$$.\n\nIf there are multiple answers, print any of them.

Then we can just divide each arc's capacity by $$$2$$$ and solve a usual minimum cost flow problem. However, when we have arcs with odd capacity, it's not that simple. We will deal with them as follows: split an arc with capacity $$$2k+1$$$ into two arcs: one with capacity $$$2k$$$, the other with capacity $$$1$$$, and somehow enforce that the second arc must be saturated. We cannot divide all arcs by $$$2$$$ now, because that would lead to non-integer capacities; instead, we will exclude these arcs with capacity $$$1$$$ and somehow handle the fact that they must be saturated, and only then divide all capacities by $$$2$$$.\nOkay, how do we handle the edges we deleted? For each vertex, let's check if the number of such arcs connected to it is even. If it is not — the total flow for this vertex cannot be $$$0$$$, so it's impossible to find the answer (the only case when it might be possible is if this vertex is the source or the sink; in this case, we need to check that both of these vertices have an odd number of arcs we want to delete connected to them, and consider an additional arc $$$1 \\rightarrow n$$$ with capacity $$$1$$$ and weight $$$0$$$ to make it even).\nIf for each vertex, the number of odd arcs connected to it is even, let's consider how much excess flow these arcs bring into the vertices. For example, if a vertex has $$$4$$$ ingoing odd arcs, it has $$$4$$$ units of flow going into it, which will be lost if we remove the edges we want to ignore. To handle this, add a new source and a new sink to our network (let's call them $$$s$$$ and $$$t$$$), and process excess flow going into the vertex using an arc from $$$s$$$ to that vertex (in the previous example, we can add an arc from $$$s$$$ to the vertex with capacity $$$2$$$ — not $$$4$$$ since we divide all capacities by $$$2$$$). Similarly, excess flow going outside the vertex can be processed with an arc from that vertex to $$$t$$$. We need to make sure that all these edges must be saturated.\nOkay, what about actually running the flow from $$$1$$$ to $$$n$$$? We can do it as in \"flow with lower bounds\" problem by adding an arc $$$n \\rightarrow 1$$$ with infinite capacity... Wait a minute, this may cause a negative cycle to appear! If your implementation of mincost flow handles them, you can use this approach; but if you don't want to mess with negative cycles, instead do the following:\n• add an arc $$$s \\rightarrow 1$$$ and an arc $$$n \\rightarrow t$$$, both with infinite capacities, to make sure that flow can go from $$$1$$$ to $$$n$$$;\n• since these arcs don't have to be saturated, but other arcs going from $$$s$$$ or into $$$t$$$ must be saturated, set the costs of these \"other\" arcs to $$$-10^9$$$.\nOkay, that's it — we just need to find the minimum cost flow in the resulting network. The constraints are low enough so any minimum cost flow algorith can pass.\n",

The solution involves using dynamic programming to efficiently track the maximum possible sum of GCDs for each possible divisor of the array elements.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Frequency Calculation**: Calculate the frequency of each element in the array.\n2. **Dynamic Programming Setup**: Use dynamic programming (DP) where `dp[d]` represents the maximum sum achievable if the GCD of the elements considered so far is `d`.\n3. **Divisor Processing**: For each possible divisor `d` starting from the maximum element down to 1, compute the total number of elements divisible by `d` and adjust the DP value by considering the maximum sum achievable for multiples of `d`.\n\nThe key insight is that for each divisor `d`, the maximum sum is derived by considering all elements divisible by `d` and subtracting the maximum sum achievable by any multiple of `d` which has already been processed. This ensures that we are always considering the highest possible GCD values first, leading to an optimal solution.\n\n### Solution Code\n```cpp\n#include <bits/stdc++.h>\nusing namespace std;\n\nint main() {\n    ios_base::sync_with_stdio(false);\n    cin.tie(0);\n\n    int n;\n    cin >> n;\n    vector<int> a(n);\n    int max_a = 0;\n    for (int i = 0; i < n; ++i) {\n        cin >> a[i];\n        max_a = max(max_a, a[i]);\n    }\n\n    vector<int> cnt(max_a + 1, 0);\n    for (int x : a) ++cnt[x];\n\n    vector<int> dp(max_a + 1, 0);\n    for (int d = max_a; d >= 1; --d) {\n        long long total = 0;\n        for (int x = d; x <= max_a; x += d)\n            total += cnt[x];\n        dp[d] = total * d;\n        for (int x = 2 * d; x <= max_a; x += d)\n            dp[d] = max(dp[d], dp[x] + (total - cnt[x]/d) * (d - x));\n    }\n\n    cout << *max_element(dp.begin(), dp.end()) << endl;\n\n    return 0;\n}\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Frequency Calculation**: The `cnt` array is used to count the occurrences of each number in the input array.\n2. **Dynamic Programming Initialization**: The `dp` array is initialized to store the maximum sum achievable for each divisor.\n3. **Divisor Processing**: For each divisor `d` from the maximum value down to 1, compute the total number of elements divisible by `d`. This total is used to calculate the initial sum contribution of `d`. The DP value for `d` is then adjusted by considering the maximum sum achievable by multiples of `d`, ensuring that we account for the optimal arrangement of elements to maximize the sum of GCDs.\n\nThis approach efficiently leverages dynamic programming and the properties of divisors to ensure that we consider the highest possible GCD values first, leading to an optimal solution in O(max_a log max_a) time complexity, which is feasible given the problem constraints.",

In one of the problems she should check if some rooted trees are isomorphic or not. She has never seen this problem before, but, being an experienced participant, she guessed that she should match trees to some sequences and then compare these sequences instead of trees. Sasha wants to match each tree with a sequence a0, a1, ..., ah, where h is the height of the tree, and ai equals to the number of vertices that are at distance of i edges from root.\n\nUnfortunately, this time Sasha's intuition was wrong, and there could be several trees matching the same sequence. To show it, you need to write a program that, given the sequence ai, builds two non-isomorphic rooted trees that match that sequence, or determines that there is only one such tree.\n\nTwo rooted trees are isomorphic, if you can reenumerate the vertices of the first one in such a way, that the index of the root becomes equal the index of the root of the second tree, and these two trees become equal.\n\nThe height of a rooted tree is the maximum number of edges on a path from the root to any other vertex.\n\nExecution time limit: 2.0 seconds\nMemory limit: 256.0 MB\n\n## Input Format\nThe first line contains a single integer h (2 ≤ h ≤ 105) — the height of the tree.\n\nThe second line contains h + 1 integers — the sequence a0, a1, ..., ah (1 ≤ ai ≤ 2·105).

It is guaranteed that there is at least one tree matching this sequence.\n\n## Output Format\nIf there is only one tree matching this sequence, print \"perfect\".\n\nOtherwise print \"ambiguous\" in the first line.

He has an unusual keyboard at his disposal: it is rectangular and it has n rows of keys containing m keys in each row. Besides, the keys are of two types. Some of the keys have lowercase Latin letters on them and some of the keys work like the \"Shift\" key on standard keyboards, that is, they make lowercase letters uppercase.\n\nVasya can press one or two keys with one hand. However, he can only press two keys if the Euclidean distance between the centers of the keys does not exceed x. The keys are considered as squares with a side equal to 1. There are no empty spaces between neighbouring keys.\n\nVasya is a very lazy boy, that's why he tries to type with one hand as he eats chips with his other one. However, it is possible that some symbol can't be typed with one hand only, because the distance between it and the closest \"Shift\" key is strictly larger than x. In this case he will have to use his other hand. Having typed the symbol, Vasya returns other hand back to the chips.\n\nYou are given Vasya's keyboard and the text.

Each line contains the descriptions of exactly m keys, without spaces. The letter keys are marked with the corresponding lowercase letters. The \"Shift\" keys are marked with the \"S\" symbol.\n\nThen follow the length of the text q (1 ≤ q ≤ 5·105).

If we select $$$l=1,r=2$$$, the resulting sequence will be $$$[0,0,0,1,1]$$$.

      "output": "To solve this problem, we need to determine the number of valid ways to paint the edges of a complete undirected graph such that each subset of vertices of size at least 2 is connected in exactly one color (either red or blue), but not both. The solution must be computed modulo 998244353.\n\n### Approach\nThe key insight is to recognize that the valid colorings correspond to the graph being partitioned into two non-empty subsets. For each such partition, edges within each subset are one color, and edges between subsets are the other color. This structure ensures that any subset of vertices will be connected in exactly one color. The number of such partitions is given by the Stirling numbers of the second kind, which count the number of ways to partition a set of `n` elements into `k` non-empty subsets. The solution involves summing these values for all valid partitions and multiplying by 2 (for the two possible color assignments).\n\n### Solution Code\n```cpp\n#include <bits/stdc++.h>\nusing namespace std;\n\nconst int MOD = 998244353;\nconst int MAXN = 5005;\n\nint stirling[MAXN][MAXN];\nint fact[MAXN];\nint inv_fact[MAXN];\n\nint mod_pow(int a, int b) {\n    int res = 1;\n    while (b) {\n        if (b & 1) res = 1LL * res * a % MOD;\n        a = 1LL * a * a % MOD;\n        b >>= 1;\n    }\n    return res;\n}\n\nvoid precompute() {\n    stirling[0][0] = 1;\n    for (int n = 1; n < MAXN; n++) {\n        for (int k = 1; k <= n; k++) {\n            stirling[n][k] = (stirling[n-1][k-1] + 1LL * k * stirling[n-1][k]) % MOD;\n        }\n    }\n    \n    fact[0] = 1;\n    for (int i = 1; i < MAXN; i++) {\n        fact[i] = 1LL * fact[i-1] * i % MOD;\n    }\n    \n    inv_fact[MAXN-1] = mod_pow(fact[MAXN-1], MOD-2);\n    for (int i = MAXN-2; i >= 0; i--) {\n        inv_fact[i] = 1LL * inv_fact[i+1] * (i+1) % MOD;\n    }\n}\n\nint main() {\n    precompute();\n    int n;\n    cin >> n;\n    int result = 0;\n    for (int k = 2; k <= n; k++) {\n        int ways = stirling[n][k];\n        ways = 1LL * ways * fact[k] % MOD;\n        result = (result + ways) % MOD;\n    }\n    result = 2LL * result % MOD;\n    cout << result << endl;\n    return 0;\n}\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Stirling Numbers of the Second Kind**: These numbers count the ways to partition `n` elements into `k` non-empty subsets. We use these to determine the number of valid partitions of the graph's vertices.\n2. **Modular Arithmetic**: Precompute factorials and their modular inverses to efficiently compute combinations and permutations modulo 998244353.\n3. **Summing Partitions**: For each valid partition (from 2 to `n` subsets), compute the number of ways to color the edges such that edges within each subset are one color and edges between subsets are the other color.\n4. **Result Calculation**: Sum the valid configurations and multiply by 2 to account for the two possible color assignments (red/blue and blue/red).\n\nThis approach efficiently computes the required number of valid colorings using dynamic programming and combinatorial mathematics, ensuring the solution is computed within the problem constraints.",

Find the biggest $$$x$$$, such that $$$f(a, x)$$$ is a palindrome.\n\nHere, $$$a \\bmod x$$$ is the remainder of the integer division of $$$a$$$ by $$$x$$$.\n\nAn array is a palindrome if it reads the same backward as forward. More formally, an array $$$a$$$ of length $$$n$$$ is a palindrome if for every $$$i$$$ ($$$1 \\leq i \\leq n$$$) $$$a_i = a_{n - i + 1}$$$.\n\n## Constraints\nTime limit per test: 2.0 seconds\nMemory limit per test: 256.0 megabytes\n\n## Input Format\nThe first line contains a single integer $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \\leq t \\leq 10^5$$$) — the number of test cases.\n\nThe first line of each test case contains a single integer $$$n$$$ ($$$1 \\leq n \\leq 10^5$$$).\n\nThe second line of each test case contains $$$n$$$ integers $$$a_i$$$ ($$$0 \\leq a_i \\leq 10^9$$$).\n\nIt's guaranteed that the sum of all $$$n$$$ does not exceed $$$10^5$$$.\n\n## Output Format\nFor each test case output the biggest $$$x$$$, such that $$$f(a, x)$$$ is a palindrome.

In our case $$$b_i = a_i \\pmod x$$$. We can rewrite the palindrome equation as $$$a_i \\pmod x = a_{n - i + 1} \\pmod x$$$. Moving all the terms to the left we get $$$a_i - a_{n - i + 1} \\equiv 0 \\pmod x$$$, which basically says $$$x$$$ divides $$$a_i - a_{n - i + 1}$$$.\nNow, how to find the biggest $$$x$$$, which satisfies all such conditions? Greatest common divisor of course! We just need to calculate the $$$GCD$$$ of the numbers $$$a_i - a_{n - i + 1}$$$ for all $$$i$$$.\nThis results in a $$$O(n + log(10^9))$$$ solution, since computing the gcd of $$$n$$$ numbers up to $$$10^9$$$ takes exactly this much time.\nA useful assumption here is that $$$GCD(x, 0) = x$$$ for any number $$$x$$$. This holds true for standard template library implementations. And do not forget that this function should work correctly for negative numbers too. An easy trick here is to just use the absolute value of $$$a_i - a_{n - i + 1}$$$.\n",

Для этого нужно всего лишь отправить сообщение с цветом в специальный чат «Зингер | color», а бот его распознает и сменит подсветку. При этом на время городских мероприятий смена цвета блокируется.\n\nФормально, бот обрабатывает три типа сообщений:\n\n- lock: заблокировать изменение цвета. Если оно и так заблокировано на данный момент, сообщение игнорируется.\n- unlock: разблокировать изменение цвета. Если оно и так разблокировано на данный момент, сообщение игнорируется.\n- red / orange / yellow / green / blue / indigo / violet: изменить цвет купола на заданный, если изменение цвета на данный момент не заблокировано.\n\nВам дана история сообщений, полученных ботом, в хронологическом порядке. Считайте, что перед получением первого сообщения купол подсвечивается голубым (blue), а изменение цвета не заблокировано.\n\nВ качестве эксперимента было решено поддержать в боте эффективную обработку редактирования сообщений. Вам дана последовательность пар вида $$$(i, msg)$$$, означающих, что $$$i$$$-е в хронологическом порядке сообщение было отредактировано и теперь имеет вид $$$msg$$$. Обратите внимание, что редактироваться может любое сообщение, и при редактировании сообщения бот должен обработать всю историю сообщений заново (в частности, перед обработкой первого сообщения цвет купола голубой, а изменение цвета не заблокировано).\n\nОпределите, какой цвет будет у купола Дома Зингера до первой операции редактирования, а также после каждой операции редактирования.\n\n## Constraints\nTime limit per test: 2.0 seconds\nMemory limit per test: 512.0 megabytes\n\n## Input Format\nВ первой строке задано одно целое число $$$n$$$ ($$$1 \\le n \\le 10^5$$$) — число сообщений, полученных ботом.\n\nВ следующих $$$n$$$ строках заданы сообщения, полученные ботом, в хронологическом порядке, по одному сообщению в строке.

Рассмотрим более эффективный подход.\nДля простоты добавим в начало хронологии сообщения unlock и blue, которые никогда не будут редактироваться, а в конец — сообщение lock.\nНазовём сообщение unlock полезным, если следующее после него в хронологическом порядке сообщение содержит цвет. Можно заметить, что меняют цвет купола те и только те «цветные» сообщения, которые идут подряд непосредственно после полезных unlock'ов. Основываясь на этом факте, можно определить итоговый цвет купола так:\n1. Найти последний полезный unlock. Обозначим его позицию через $$$p$$$. (Хотя бы один полезный unlock существует, так как мы добавили в начало сообщения unlock и blue.)\n2. Найти следующий после позиции $$$p$$$ lock или unlock. Обозначим его позицию через $$$q$$$.\n3. Сообщение $$$q-1$$$ содержит искомый цвет.\nБудем поддерживать два упорядоченных множества — множество $$$a$$$, содержащее позиции всех полезных unlock'ов, и множество $$$b$$$, содержащее позиции всех lock'ов и unlock'ов вместе взятых.\nПосле редактирования сообщения $$$i$$$ нужно добавить в множества или удалить из них только позиции $$$i$$$ и $$$i-1$$$, а затем определить новый цвет купола по описанной выше последовательности действий. Соответственно, всего нужно выполнить $$$O(1)$$$ операций с множествами.\nОт множеств нам нужно эффективное выполнение операций добавления, удаления, поиска, взятия максимального элемента, и взятия следующего в отсортированном порядке элемента. С этим справится любое сбалансированное дерево поиска. Можно воспользоваться встроенными во многие языки структурами данных: например, в C++ подойдёт std::set, в Java — TreeSet. Такие структуры выполняют требуемые операции за $$$O(\\log n)$$$.\nИтоговая сложность решения составляет $$$O(t \\log n)$$$.\nПример решения на C++:\n",

Here $$$\\&$$$ denotes the bitwise AND operation.\n\nYou are going to organize a bridge tournament capable of accommodating at most $$$k$$$ pairs of players (bridge is played in teams of two people). You can select teams arbitrarily while each player is in at most one team, but there is one catch: two players cannot be in the same pair if they disagree on $$$2$$$ or more of those $$$n$$$ topics, as they would argue too much during the play.\n\nYou know that the $$$i$$$-th player will pay you $$$a_i$$$ dollars if they play in this tournament.

Although pairing the $$$0$$$-th player with the $$$5$$$-th player would give us $$$8 + 10 = 18$$$ dollars, we cannot do this because those two players disagree on $$$2$$$ of the $$$3$$$ hot topics.\n\nIn the second example, we can pair the $$$0$$$-th player with the $$$1$$$-st player and pair the $$$2$$$-nd player with the $$$3$$$-rd player resulting in earnings of $$$7 + 4 + 5 + 7 = 23$$$ dollars.\n\n## Editorial\nLet's make a graph in which the vertices are the players and there is an edge of weight $$$a_i + a_j$$$ between the $$$i$$$-th and the $$$j$$$-th player if they can play together. We can notice that the problem can then be solved by finding a matching of size at most $$$k$$$ with the biggest sum of weights in this graph.\nTo solve this problem efficiently we can make the following observations:\n1. The graph is bipartite.\nThis stands from the fact that if two players disagree at exactly $$$1$$$ topic then the numbers of positive views that they hold have different parities.\n2. We can limit ourselves to considering only the $$$(2n-1)(k-1) + 1$$$ edges with the biggest weights.\nWe can prove this with a proof by contradiction. Firstly, we can notice that if we use a particular edge in the matching then we prohibit ourselves from using at most $$$2(n-1)$$$ other edges with each of the matched vertices being incident to exactly $$$n-1$$$ of those edges, because each vertex has degree $$$n$$$ in this graph. Now we can see that if we were to use an edge that's not one of those $$$(2n-1)(k-1)+1$$$ best ones, then we can just replace it with one of those best ones, because we know that at least one of them will not be prohibited.\nCombining those two observations we are left with a bipartite graph with $$$O(nk)$$$ edges and $$$O(nk)$$$ vertices in which we can find a matching with maximum cost and size at most $$$k$$$ with for example one of the standard min cost max flow algorithms (we can look for a matching of size $$$k$$$ because all edges have non-negative weights).\nThe only problem that's left for us to solve is efficiently selecting those best edges. Because there are $$$O(n2^n)$$$ edges in total we cannot use a standard sorting algorithm as that would run in $$$O(n^2 2^n)$$$. Instead we can for example use the quick select algorithm which solves this problem in $$$O(n2^n)$$$.\nOur final time complexity is then $$$O(n2^n + nk^2\\log(kn))$$$.\n",
      "output": "To solve this problem, we need to maximize the total amount of money earned by pairing up to k pairs of players such that each pair does not disagree on 2 or more topics. Each player's views on topics are represented by a bitmask, and two players can be paired if their bitmasks differ by exactly one bit.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Graph Construction**: Represent each player as a node and create edges between nodes where players can be paired (bitmask differs by exactly one bit). The weight of each edge is the sum of the money values of the two players.\n2. **Select Top Edges**: Given the constraints, we can limit the number of edges considered to a manageable number using a formula derived from the problem's constraints. This reduces the problem size significantly.\n3. **Flow Network**: Convert the problem into a maximum weight bipartite matching problem using a flow network. The bipartition is based on the parity of the number of set bits in the player's bitmask.\n4. **Min-Cost Max-Flow Algorithm**: Use a min-cost max-flow algorithm to find the optimal pairing, ensuring that we maximize the total money earned while respecting the constraints on the number of pairs.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nfrom collections import defaultdict\nimport heapq\n\nclass Edge:\n    def __init__(self, to, rev, cap, cost):\n        self.to = to\n        self.rev = rev\n        self.cap = cap\n        self.cost = cost\n\ndef add_edge(graph, fr, to, cap, cost):\n    forward = Edge(to, len(graph[to]), cap, cost)\n    backward = Edge(fr, len(graph[fr]), 0, -cost)\n    graph[fr].append(forward)\n    graph[to].append(backward)\n\ndef min_cost_flow(graph, source, sink, max_flow):\n    res = 0\n    h = defaultdict(int)  # Potential\n    prev_v = dict()\n    prev_e = dict()\n    flow = 0\n    while flow < max_flow:\n        dist = defaultdict(lambda: float('inf'))\n        dist[source] = 0\n        heap = []\n        heapq.heappush(heap, (0, source))\n        while heap:\n            d, u = heapq.heappop(heap)\n            if d > dist[u]:\n                continue\n            for e in graph[u]:\n                if e.cap > 0 and dist[e.to] > d + e.cost + h[u] - h[e.to]:\n                    dist[e.to] = d + e.cost + h[u] - h[e.to]\n                    prev_v[e.to] = u\n                    prev_e[e.to] = e\n                    heapq.heappush(heap, (dist[e.to], e.to))\n        if dist[sink] == float('inf'):\n            break\n        for u in h:\n            if u in dist:\n                h[u] += dist[u]\n        d_flow = max_flow - flow\n        v = sink\n        while v != source:\n            d_flow = min(d_flow, prev_e[v].cap)\n            v = prev_v[v]\n        flow += d_flow\n        res += d_flow * (h[sink] - h[source])\n        v = sink\n        while v != source:\n            e = prev_e[v]\n            e.cap -= d_flow\n            graph[e.to][e.rev].cap += d_flow\n            v = prev_v[v]\n    return res\n\ndef main():\n    import sys\n    input = sys.stdin.read().split()\n    idx = 0\n    n = int(input[idx])\n    idx += 1\n    k = int(input[idx])\n    idx += 1\n    a = list(map(int, input[idx:idx + (1 << n)]))\n    idx += (1 << n)\n    \n    edges = []\n    for u in range(1 << n):\n        for j in range(n):\n            v = u ^ (1 << j)\n            if v > u:\n                sum_uv = a[u] + a[v]\n                edges.append((-sum_uv, u, v))\n    \n    M = (2 * n - 1) * (k - 1) + 1\n    edges.sort()\n    if len(edges) > M:\n        edges = edges[:M]\n    selected_edges = [(-sum_uv, u, v) for sum_uv, u, v in edges]\n    selected_edges.sort(reverse=True)\n    selected_edges = selected_edges[:M]\n    \n    left_nodes = set()\n    right_nodes = set()\n    for sum_uv, u, v in selected_edges:\n        left_nodes.add(u)\n        right_nodes.add(v)\n    \n    source = (1 << n)\n    sink = (1 << n) + 1\n    graph = defaultdict(list)\n    \n    for u in left_nodes:\n        add_edge(graph, source, u, 1, 0)\n    for v in right_nodes:\n        add_edge(graph, v, sink, 1, 0)\n    for sum_uv, u, v in selected_edges:\n        add_edge(graph, u, v, 1, -sum_uv)\n    \n    total_cost = min_cost_flow(graph, source, sink, k)\n    print(-total_cost)\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Graph Construction**: We generate all valid edges where two players differ by exactly one bit.

He built a deque filled with $$$n$$$ elements. The $$$i$$$-th element is $$$a_i$$$ ($$$i$$$ = $$$1, 2, \\ldots, n$$$). He gradually takes the first two leftmost elements from the deque (let's call them $$$A$$$ and $$$B$$$, respectively), and then does the following: if $$$A > B$$$, he writes $$$A$$$ to the beginning and writes $$$B$$$ to the end of the deque, otherwise, he writes to the beginning $$$B$$$, and $$$A$$$ writes to the end of the deque. We call this sequence of actions an operation.\n\nFor example, if deque was $$$[2, 3, 4, 5, 1]$$$, on the operation he will write $$$B=3$$$ to the beginning and $$$A=2$$$ to the end, so he will get $$$[3, 4, 5, 1, 2]$$$.\n\nThe teacher of the course, seeing Valeriy, who was passionate about his work, approached him and gave him $$$q$$$ queries. Each query consists of the singular number $$$m_j$$$ $$$(j = 1, 2, \\ldots, q)$$$. It is required for each query to answer which two elements he will pull out on the $$$m_j$$$-th operation.\n\nNote that the queries are independent and for each query the numbers $$$A$$$ and $$$B$$$ should be printed in the order in which they will be pulled out of the deque.\n\nDeque is a data structure representing a list of elements where insertion of new elements or deletion of existing elements can be made from both sides.\n\n## Constraints\nTime limit per test: 6.0 seconds\nMemory limit per test: 256.0 megabytes\n\n## Input Format\nThe first line contains two integers $$$n$$$ and $$$q$$$ ($$$2 \\leq n \\leq 10^5$$$, $$$0 \\leq q \\leq 3 \\cdot 10^5$$$) — the number of elements in the deque and the number of queries. The second line contains $$$n$$$ integers $$$a_1$$$, $$$a_2$$$, ..., $$$a_n$$$, where $$$a_i$$$ $$$(0 \\leq a_i \\leq 10^9)$$$ — the deque element in $$$i$$$-th position. The next $$$q$$$ lines contain one number each, meaning $$$m_j$$$ ($$$1 \\leq m_j \\leq 10^{18}$$$).\n\n## Output Format\nFor each teacher's query, output two numbers $$$A$$$ and $$$B$$$ — the numbers that Valeriy pulls out of the deque for the $$$m_j$$$-th operation.\n\n## Examples\n```input\n5 3\n1 2 3 4 5\n1\n2\n10\n```\n```output\n1 2\n2 3\n5 2\n```\n-----\n```input\n2 0\n0 0\n```\n```output\n\n```\n\n## Note\n1. $$$[1, 2, 3, 4, 5]$$$ — on the first operation, $$$A$$$ and $$$B$$$ are $$$1$$$ and $$$2$$$, respectively.So, $$$2$$$ we write to the beginning of the deque, and $$$1$$$ — to the end.We get the following status of the deque: $$$[2, 3, 4, 5, 1]$$$.\n2. $$$[2, 3, 4, 5, 1] \\Rightarrow A = 2, B = 3$$$.\n3. $$$[3, 4, 5, 1, 2]$$$\n4. $$$[4, 5, 1, 2, 3]$$$\n5. $$$[5, 1, 2, 3, 4]$$$\n6. $$$[5, 2, 3, 4, 1]$$$\n7. $$$[5, 3, 4, 1, 2]$$$\n8. $$$[5, 4, 1, 2, 3]$$$\n9. $$$[5, 1, 2, 3, 4]$$$\n10. $$$[5, 2, 3, 4, 1] \\Rightarrow A = 5, B = 2$$$.\n",

The distance which he needs to pass equals to d kilometers.\n\nVasiliy's car is not new — it breaks after driven every k kilometers and Vasiliy needs t seconds to repair it. After repairing his car Vasiliy can drive again (but after k kilometers it will break again, and so on). In the beginning of the trip the car is just from repair station.\n\nTo drive one kilometer on car Vasiliy spends a seconds, to walk one kilometer on foot he needs b seconds (a < b).\n\nYour task is to find minimal time after which Vasiliy will be able to reach the post office.

So the answer equals to 14 seconds.\n\nIn the second example Vasiliy needs to drive the first 2 kilometers on the car (in 2 seconds), then repair his car (in 5 seconds) and drive 2 kilometers more on the car (in 2 seconds). After that he needs to walk on foot 1 kilometer (in 4 seconds). So the answer equals to 13 seconds.\n\n## Editorial\nTo solve this problem we need to analyze some cases.\nIf d ≤ k then Vasiliy can ride car all road without breaking, so the answer is d * a.\nIf t + k * a > k * b (i. e. it is better to do not repair the car), Vasiliy must ride car the first k kilometers and then walks on foot, so the answer is k * a + (d - k) * b.\nThe only case left when it is better to ride car through all road until d % k kilometers left. Now we need to understand what better — repair the car and ride or do not repair the car and walk on foot. Let cnt = d / k, so Vasiliy necessarily must repair the car cnt - 1 times. Then the answer equals to k * cnt * a + (cnt - 1) * t + min(t + (d % k) * a, (d % k) * b).\n",

For this reason, two words \"ulyana\" and \"oolyana\" denote the same name.\n\nThe second ambiguity is about the Berland sound h: one can use both \"h\" and \"kh\" to write it. For example, the words \"mihail\" and \"mikhail\" denote the same name.\n\nThere are n users registered on the Polycarp's website. Each of them indicated a name represented by the Latin letters. How many distinct names are there among them, if two ambiguities described above are taken into account?\n\nFormally, we assume that two words denote the same name, if using the replacements \"u\" $$\\text{The formula used to produce the text is not provided in the image.}$$ \"oo\" and \"h\" $$\\text{The formula used to produce the text is not provided in the image.}$$ \"kh\", you can make the words equal. One can make replacements in both directions, in any of the two words an arbitrary number of times.

There are $$$n$$$ cupcake types, arranged from $$$1$$$ to $$$n$$$ on the shelf, and there are infinitely many of each type. The tastiness of a cupcake of type $$$i$$$ is an integer $$$a_i$$$. There are both tasty and nasty cupcakes, so the tastiness can be positive, zero or negative.\n\nYasser, of course, wants to try them all, so he will buy exactly one cupcake of each type.\n\nOn the other hand, Adel will choose some segment $$$[l, r]$$$ $$$(1 \\le l \\le r \\le n)$$$ that does not include all of cupcakes (he can't choose $$$[l, r] = [1, n]$$$) and buy exactly one cupcake of each of types $$$l, l + 1, \\dots, r$$$.\n\nAfter that they will compare the total tastiness of the cupcakes each of them have bought. Yasser will be happy if the total tastiness of cupcakes he buys is strictly greater than the total tastiness of cupcakes Adel buys regardless of Adel's choice.\n\nFor example, let the tastinesses of the cupcakes be $$$[7, 4, -1]$$$. Yasser will buy all of them, the total tastiness will be $$$7 + 4 - 1 = 10$$$. Adel can choose segments $$$[7], [4], [-1], [7, 4]$$$ or $$$[4, -1]$$$, their total tastinesses are $$$7, 4, -1, 11$$$ and $$$3$$$, respectively. Adel can choose segment with tastiness $$$11$$$, and as $$$10$$$ is not strictly greater than $$$11$$$, Yasser won't be happy :(\n\nFind out if Yasser will be happy after visiting the shop.\n\n## Constraints\nTime limit per test: 1.0 seconds\nMemory limit per test: 256.0 megabytes\n\n## Input Format\nEach test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of test cases $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \\le t \\le 10^4$$$). The description of the test cases follows.\n\nThe first line of each test case contains $$$n$$$ ($$$2 \\le n \\le 10^5$$$).\n\nThe second line of each test case contains $$$n$$$ integers $$$a_1, a_2, \\dots, a_n$$$ ($$$-10^9 \\le a_i \\le 10^9$$$), where $$$a_i$$$ represents the tastiness of the $$$i$$$-th type of cupcake.\n\nIt is guaranteed that the sum of $$$n$$$ over all test cases doesn't exceed $$$10^5$$$.\n\n## Output Format\nFor each test case, print \"YES\", if the total tastiness of cupcakes Yasser buys will always be strictly greater than the total tastiness of cupcakes Adel buys regardless of Adel's choice. Otherwise, print \"NO\".\n\n## Examples\n```input\n3\n4\n1 2 3 4\n3\n7 4 -1\n3\n5 -5 5\n```\n```output\nYES\nNO\nNO\n```\n\n## Note\nIn the first example, the total tastiness of any segment Adel can choose is less than the total tastiness of all cupcakes.\n\nIn the second example, Adel will choose the segment $$$[1, 2]$$$ with total tastiness $$$11$$$, which is not less than the total tastiness of all cupcakes, which is $$$10$$$.\n\nIn the third example, Adel can choose the segment $$$[3, 3]$$$ with total tastiness of $$$5$$$. Note that Yasser's cupcakes' total tastiness is also $$$5$$$, so in that case, the total tastiness of Yasser's cupcakes isn't strictly greater than the total tastiness of Adel's cupcakes.\n\n## Editorial\nIf there is at least a prefix or a suffix with non-positive sum, we can delete that prefix/suffix and end up with an array with sum $$$\\geq$$$ the sum of the whole array. So, if that's the case, the answer is \"NO\".\nOtherwise, all the segments that Adel can choose will have sum $$$<$$$ than the sum of the whole array because the elements that are not in the segment will always have a strictly positive sum. So, in that case, the answer is \"YES\".\nTime complexity: $$$O(n)$$$\n",

Return the minimum power consumed. If l is equal to r then do not go into recursion further, return power consumed according to first operation. One thing is remaining, the value of x, given l and r. Sort the array containing indices of avengers and then find positions of l and r in that array using binary search. Difference is positions of l and r in array will give x. Time Complexity : $$$O(n*k*log(k))$$$. Explanation : Reaching any subarray will take maximum of n operations and we can have maximum k subarrays (each having one avenger), it will take $$$O(n*k)$$$. $$$O(log(k))$$$ time needed for binary search (calculating x).

This can be done, for example, using queries aaa ... aaa and bbb ... bbb of length $$$300$$$. Let the answers to these queries be $$$q_a$$$ and $$$q_b$$$, then the number of letters a and b would be $$$\\#a = 300 - q_a$$$ and $$$\\#b = 300 - q_b$$$ respectively. These answers are explained by the fact that i. e. for string aaa ... aaa it takes $$$300 - \\#a - \\#b$$$ steps to remove the letters a at the end of the string and then replace $$$\\#b$$$ letters a with b to change the string aaa ... aaa into the string $$$s$$$.\nNow we know the length $$$l = \\#a + \\#b$$$. Consider an arbitrary string $$$t$$$ of length $$$l$$$ and let the answer to its query be $$$q$$$. Then if we replace the letter $$$t_i$$$ with the opposite one (from a to b or from b to a), then we may have one of two situations:\n• $$$q $$$ decreased by $$$1$$$, then the letter $$$t_i$$$ after the change coincides with the letter $$$s_i$$$.\n• otherwise the letter $$$t_i$$$ before the change matches the letter $$$s_i$$$.\nThus, you can loop from left to right and for each position $$$i$$$ find out the character $$$t_i$$$, starting, for example, from the string aaa ... aaa of length $$$l$$$.\nThe current algorithm guesses the string in $$$n + 3$$$ queries. In order to get rid of one unnecessary query, note that we do not need to make a query to find out the character in the last position. If the number of letters a whose location we know is equal to $$$\\#a$$$, then the last character cannot be a, which means it is b. Similarly for the symmetric case.\nThus, we can guess the string in $$$n + 2$$$ queries.\nSimilarly, it is possible to solve for an arbitrary alphabet in $$$(|\\Sigma| - 1) n + 2$$$ queries, where $$$|\\Sigma|$$$ is the size of the alphabet. For an arbitrary alphabet, there is also a solution using random which solves the problem on average in $$$\\frac{|\\Sigma|}{2} n + 2$$$ queries, but it will not work in this task, since the chance to spend more than $$$n + 2$$$ queries is quite large.\n",
      "output": "To solve this problem, we need to determine the hidden spell string `s` consisting of characters 'a' and 'b' using a maximum of `n + 2` queries, where `n` is the length of `s`. The solution involves determining the number of 'a's and 'b's in `s` and then reconstructing the string step-by-step.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Determine Character Counts**: \n   - First, send two queries with strings of 300 'a's and 300 'b's. The responses will help determine the number of 'a's and 'b's in `s`.\n   \n2. **Reconstruct the String**:\n   - Start with an initial guess of a string composed entirely of 'a's of length `n` (sum of 'a's and 'b's).\n   - Iterate through each character position (except the last one) and flip the character. If the edit distance decreases, keep the change; otherwise, revert it.\n   - Determine the last character based on the counts of 'a's and 'b's derived earlier to avoid an extra query.\n\n### Solution Code\n```cpp\n#include <iostream>\n#include <string>\n\nusing namespace std;\n\nint main() {\n    ios::sync_with_stdio(false);\n    cin.tie(nullptr);\n\n    string a_query(300, 'a');\n    string b_query(300, 'b');\n\n    cout << a_query << endl;\n    int q_a;\n    cin >> q_a;\n\n    cout << b_query << endl;\n    int q_b;\n    cin >> q_b;\n\n    int a_count = 300 - q_a;\n    int b_count = 300 - q_b;\n    int l = a_count + b_count;\n\n    string t(l, 'a');\n    cout << t << endl;\n    int D;\n    cin >> D;\n\n    for (int i = 0; i < l - 1; ++i) {\n        t[i] = 'b';\n        cout << t << endl;\n        int Di;\n        cin >> Di;\n        if (Di < D) {\n            D = Di;\n        } else {\n            t[i] = 'a';\n        }\n    }\n\n    int sum_a = 0;\n    for (int i = 0; i < l - 1; ++i) {\n        sum_a += (t[i] == 'a');\n    }\n\n    if (sum_a == a_count) {\n        t.back() = 'b';\n    } else {\n        t.back() = 'a';\n    }\n\n    cout << t << endl;\n\n    return 0;\n}\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Initial Queries**: The first two queries determine the counts of 'a' and 'b' in the hidden string `s` by leveraging the edit distance from all 'a's and all 'b's of length 300.\n2. **String Reconstruction**: Using the initial guess of all 'a's, the algorithm iterates through each character (except the last) and checks if flipping it reduces the edit distance. This step efficiently narrows down the correct characters.\n3. **Final Character Determination**: The last character is determined based on the known counts of 'a's and 'b's, avoiding an additional query and ensuring the solution stays within the allowed query limit.\n\nThis approach ensures that the solution uses exactly `n + 2` queries, adhering to the problem constraints and efficiently determining the hidden string `s`.",

      "output": "<think>\nOkay, let's see. The problem is to compute the sum of the depths of all possible bracket sequences formed by replacing the '?' in the input string with '(' or ')'. Then return this sum modulo 998244353.\n\nFirst, I need to understand how to compute the depth of a single bracket sequence. The depth here is the maximum depth of any correct bracket subsequence (after possibly deleting some characters). For example, the depth of \"()(())\" is 2 because the maximum depth is when the entire sequence is considered, but wait, no. Wait, the correct sequence formed by \"()(())\" would have depth 2. The first () is depth 1, then the (()) is depth 2, and the overall maximum is 2. So the depth is the maximum depth achieved by any part of the sequence.\n\nBut the problem says, for a given bracket sequence s (which might not be correct), the depth is the maximum depth of any correct bracket sequence induced by removing some characters. So for each possible way to replace the '?', we need to compute the maximum depth of all possible correct subsequences, and sum that across all possible replacements.\n\nHmm. That seems tricky. How do we compute this efficiently for all possible 2^k possibilities, where k is the number of '?'s in the input string? For n up to 2000, that's impossible to do directly, since k can be 2000, leading to 2^2000 possibilities. So we need a dynamic programming approach.\n\nWait, the key is to model the problem in such a way that we can compute the sum over all possible replacements, but without enumerating each possibility. So perhaps we can model it with DP that keeps track of certain parameters, multiplied by the number of ways certain choices can be made.\n\nThe problem is to compute the sum of the depths for all possible bracket sequences. The depth for a single sequence is the maximum depth of any correct subsequence in it. Let's think about how to model this.\n\nAn alternative approach: For each possible d, compute the number of bracket sequences where the maximum depth is exactly d, then sum d multiplied by that count. But even that might not be straightforward.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps we can model the maximum depth directly in the DP. Let's think: for each position in the string, and for each possible current balance (number of open parentheses minus closed), track the maximum depth achievable up to that point, and the number of ways that this can happen. But I'm not sure how to track the maximum depth over all possible correct subsequences here.\n\nWait, but the maximum depth of a correct bracket sequence can be found by considering the maximum number of nested parentheses in any valid subsequence. For example, in the case of the correct sequence \"((()))\", the maximum depth is 3. So how is this computed?\n\nIn a correct bracket sequence, the maximum depth is determined by the maximum number of open parentheses at any point. For example, each time you open a parenthesis, the current depth increases by 1, and when you close it, it decreases. The maximum over this is the depth of the sequence. But this applies only to the entire correct sequence. However, when the entire sequence is not correct, the depth is the maximum possible depth over all possible correct subsequences that can be formed by deleting some characters.\n\nWait, but how to compute the depth for a given bracket sequence s? The depth is the maximum d such that there exists a correct bracket subsequence of s with depth d. For example, in the sample input \"??\", which can be \"()\", the depth is 1. For \"(()\", the depth is 1 (the subsequence \"()\" has depth 1, and the entire sequence is not correct, but the maximum correct subsequence could be two \"()\" pairs, but perhaps not nested).\n\nWait, perhaps the maximum depth is the maximum number of pairs of parentheses that can be nested. So for example, in \"(()\", the correct subsequence \"()\" (the first two characters) has depth 1, or the subsequence formed by the first and third characters (but that's \")(\", which is not valid). So the maximum depth is 1. But if the original string is \"(()\", then there's a correct subsequence \"()\" (second and third characters?), but perhaps not. Hmm, maybe this approach is getting stuck. Let's think again.\n\nAnother way to compute the depth of a bracket sequence s: the maximum depth is the maximum value of (current number of open parentheses) during a traversal of a correct subsequence of s. So how do we model that?\n\nWait, for a correct bracket sequence, the maximum depth is the maximum number of open parentheses at any point. For example, \"((()))\" has a max depth of 3. But how does this apply when the sequence is not correct, but we can select a correct subsequence?\n\nThe correct subsequence must form a valid sequence when characters are deleted. For example, in \"())\", we can select the first two characters to form \"()\", which has depth 1. So the maximum depth here is 1.\n\nBut to find the maximum possible depth of any correct subsequence in the original sequence, perhaps the approach is similar to the standard way of finding the maximum depth in a correct sequence, but considering that we can choose which characters to keep.\n\nWait, perhaps the maximum depth of a bracket sequence is the maximum over all possible correct subsequences of that sequence's depth. But how to compute this for a given sequence efficiently?\n\nAlternatively, the maximum depth can be computed using dynamic programming. For a given sequence, we can track the possible balances and the current maximum depth. Let's model this.\n\nFor example, for each position i in the string, and for each possible balance b (number of open minus closed), track the maximum depth achievable up to i with balance b. Then, for each character in the string, we can decide whether to include it or not (but in this problem, the depth is based on the entire sequence, not a subsequence? Wait no: the depth is the maximum over all possible correct subsequences of the original sequence. So the maximum depth is the maximum depth of any correct bracket subsequence that can be formed by deleting some characters (possibly none) from the original sequence. So the problem is, for each possible replacement of '?', compute the maximum depth of any correct subsequence of that sequence, then sum all those maximum depths across all possible replacements.\n\nSo for each possible replacement of '?' into '(' or ')', we have a bracket sequence s. For s, compute the maximum depth of any correct subsequence of s, then sum all these depths.\n\nThe challenge is to compute this sum efficiently.\n\nNow, the key is to model this computation using dynamic programming that tracks the necessary parameters across all possible replacements.\n\nLet me think: for each position in the original string, and for each possible balance (number of open - close), and the current maximum depth, track the number of ways that this can happen given the choices made so far for the '?'.\n\nWait, but that's probably too complex. Let's see: perhaps the maximum depth of a correct subsequence of s is equal to the maximum number of open parentheses that can be maintained at any point in a valid way.\n\nWait, here's a different approach: to compute the maximum depth of s, we can model it as the maximum over all possible correct bracket sequences formed by s (as subsequences) of their individual depths.\n\nThe depth of a correct bracket sequence is the maximum number of open parentheses at any point during the traversal of the sequence. So for example, \"(()())\" has a sequence that when traversed, the open count goes 1, 2, 1, 2, 1, 0. So the maximum depth is 2.\n\nSo for a given s, the maximum depth is the maximum number of open parentheses at any point in any correct subsequence of s.\n\nBut how do we compute this?\n\nAn alternative approach: the maximum depth for s is the maximum number of pairs of parentheses that can be nested. For example, in the sample input \"??\", the replacement \"()\" gives a depth of 1. So maybe the depth is the maximum number of pairs that can be nested, but I'm not sure.\n\nAlternatively, think of the process to form a correct subsequence. We need to select a subsequence that forms a correct bracket sequence. Among all such possible subsequences, the maximum depth is the maximum number of open parentheses at any point during the traversal of the subsequence.\n\nSo, the problem for a single s is to find the maximum depth over all possible correct subsequences of s.\n\nBut how to compute this for all possible s (each possible replacement of ?) and sum the results.\n\nHmm. For each possible replacement, compute the maximum depth, sum over all 2^k possibilities.\n\nBut for n up to 2000, we need an O(n^3) approach or better.\n\nLet me think of the DP approach. Let's model the problem by considering for each position in the string, and for each possible current balance (number of open minus closed in the chosen subsequence), and the current maximum depth. Then, for each possible choice of replacing '?', we track how these parameters change.\n\nWait, but the problem is that for each replacement, the entire string is fixed, and then the maximum depth is computed. So perhaps for each position, and for each possible state (current balance, current maximum depth, and the minimal required parameters), we can model the possible ways the characters can be chosen (for the ?) and how they contribute to the sum.\n\nAlternatively, for each position i, and a given possible current balance (open - close) in the subsequence up to i, and the current maximum depth encountered so far, and the possible minimum balance (to ensure that the balance never drops below zero), track the number of ways that this can occur. Then, when processing the next character (which could be '(', ')', or replaced as either), we can update the state transitions accordingly.\n\nBut this seems complicated. Let's think again.\n\nAnother approach: the maximum depth of the entire string (after replacing ?) is equal to the maximum number of open parentheses in any valid correct subsequence of that string. So for the entire string s, the maximum depth is the maximum over all possible correct subsequences of s of the maximum number of open parentheses during their traversal.\n\nSo, for a given s, how can we compute this maximum depth?\n\nLet's model this with dynamic programming. Let's consider for each position i in s, and for each possible current balance (open - close), track the maximum number of open parentheses (max depth) that can be achieved in a subsequence up to i, while maintaining a non-negative balance.\n\nWait, yes. For example:\n\nAt each step, for a character c in s (after replacement), when building a correct subsequence, the balance must never drop below 0.\n\nSo, for each position i in the string, and for each possible balance b (current open - close in the subsequence), we can track the maximum depth (max open count) achieved so far.\n\nSo the DP state can be dp[i][b] = the maximum depth achievable considering the first i characters, with a current balance of b, and ensuring that the balance never drops below 0.\n\nFor each character in s, we can choose to include it or not in the subsequence. However, since we want to maximize the depth, we need to choose the best option.\n\nBut since the problem requires the sum over all possible replacements of '?', we need to track, for each possible state (i, balance, current_max_depth), the number of ways that these parameters can be achieved, multiplied by the contributions to the sum.\n\nWait, but how to model the sum of the maximum depths across all possible replacements. Let's see: for each possible replacement, the maximum depth is determined by the best possible correct subsequence. So, for each replacement, the sum adds the maximum possible depth that can be achieved in that particular s.\n\nHmm. So the problem is to compute, for all possible s (each s is a choice of replacing each ? with ( or )), the maximum depth of s, and sum all those depths.\n\nThis seems challenging because for each s, the maximum depth could be different. So how to model this in a way that allows us to compute the sum efficiently.\n\nPerhaps, instead of tracking the sum of maximum depths directly, we can find for each possible d, the number of s where the maximum depth is exactly d, then sum d multiplied by that count. So the answer is the sum over d (d * count_d), where count_d is the number of s where the maximum depth is d.\n\nBut even this approach requires being able to compute count_d for all d. How can we model this?\n\nAn alternative idea: for each position in the string, track the possible balance and the maximum depth so far, along with the number of ways that this can happen, considering the possible choices of replacing '?' up to that point.\n\nBut since the maximum depth can vary, we need to track it in the state. However, the maximum depth can be up to n/2 (since each depth level requires a pair). For n=2000, this is 1000. So combining this with balance (which can be up to 2000 as well), the state could be (i, balance, current_max_depth). For i up to 2000, balance up to 2000, current_max_depth up to 2000, the total states would be 2000 * 2000 * 2000 = 8e10, which is way too big.\n\nThis is not feasible. So we need a smarter approach.\n\nAnother observation: the maximum depth for a correct subsequence is the maximum number of open parentheses in any prefix of that subsequence. So for a correct subsequence s', the depth is the maximum of the current balance at each step of s'. So the depth of s' is the maximum balance during s'.\n\nThe problem is to find the maximum depth over all possible s' (correct subsequences of s) for each s (after replacing the ?).\n\nSo for each s, the maximum depth is the maximum possible max_balance over all correct subsequences s' of s.\n\nBut how to compute this for a given s?\n\nAn alternative approach for a single s: the maximum depth is the maximum number of open parentheses that can be achieved in any correct subsequence. To find this, perhaps we can model it with a dynamic programming approach where for each position i, and possible current balance, track the maximum possible max_balance up to that point.\n\nFor example:\n\nLet's define dp[i][b] as the maximum possible max_balance when considering the first i characters of s, with a current balance of b (after processing those characters in the subsequence), and ensuring that the balance never goes negative.\n\nWe can process each character of s in order. For each character, we have the option to include it or not in the subsequence.\n\nIf the character is '(' (or replaced as '('), then if we include it, the balance becomes b+1, and the max_balance could be the previous max_balance or (b+1). So for this case:\n\nIf we include it, the new balance is b+1, and the new max_balance is max(current_max_balance, b+1).\n\nIf we exclude it, the state remains the same.\n\nSimilarly, if the character is ')', including it would require that the current balance is at least 1, so that after adding it, the balance is b-1 >= 0. Then, the new max_balance is the previous max_balance.\n\nBut since we are looking for the maximum possible max_balance, we need to take the maximum over all possible choices (include or exclude the character).\n\nBut for our problem, the characters are not fixed; each '?' can be replaced by '(' or ')', and we need to sum the maximum depth for all possible replacements. So this adds another layer of complexity.\n\nSo, perhaps the way to proceed is to model a dynamic programming that tracks, for each position in the original string, the possible current balance and maximum depth (max_balance) up to that point, along with the number of ways that this can be achieved (considering the possible replacements of '?').\n\nThen, the sum would be the sum over all possible final states of (max_balance * number_of_ways).\n\nBut how to model this.\n\nThe state would be (i, balance, max_balance). For each position i, and possible balance and max_balance, track the number of ways that, after processing i characters, the current balance is 'balance' and the maximum balance achieved so far is 'max_balance'.\n\nFor each transition, considering the next character (which can be '(', ')', or a '?' which can be either).\n\nFor each possible choice (depending on the current character), we can model the transitions:\n\nIf the current character is '(' or replaced as '(', then when processing this character, the option is to include it in the subsequence or not. However, since we are trying to find the maximum possible max_balance, including it would be the optimal choice. Wait, but since we are considering all possible subsequences, the maximum is over all possible subsequences. However, for each replacement of '?', the s is fixed, and then the maximum depth is computed over all possible subsequences of s.\n\nSo for a given s, the maximum depth is determined by the best possible subsequence (the one that gives the highest depth). So for each replacement of '?', the maximum depth is the maximum possible over all possible correct subsequences of s.\n\nThus, for each s, the maximum depth is the maximum possible max_balance achievable through any correct subsequence of s.\n\nTherefore, to model this, for each s, the maximum depth is the result of a DP that for each position, tracks the maximum possible max_balance and current balance.\n\nBut how to model this for all possible s and sum the maximum depth across all s?\n\nHmm. Maybe we can model the sum by considering for each possible state (i, balance, current_max), the number of ways that this state can be achieved, multiplied by the contribution to the sum. But since the maximum depth is the maximum current_max over all possible paths in the DP for a given s, this is not straightforward.\n\nAlternative idea: The sum over all s is equal to the sum of the maximum current_max for each s. But how to compute this sum?\n\nAnother approach: For each position i, and possible balance and current_max, track the number of ways that the current_max is the maximum possible up to i for some replacement choices, and also track the current_max value. Then, when processing the next characters, update the state accordingly. However, this seems difficult because the maximum could be updated in later steps.\n\nWait, but the maximum depth is the maximum current_max over all possible steps in the best possible subsequence for each s. So for each s, the maximum depth is the maximum over all possible paths in the DP for that s.\n\nBut how to model this for all possible s.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps we can model the problem in a way that allows us to accumulate the contributions to the sum as we build the DP. For each state in the DP, track the number of ways to reach that state (considering the choices made for the '?') and the current maximum depth. Then, at each step, the sum is updated with the possible contributions.\n\nBut I'm not sure. Let's think differently.\n\nLet's model the problem with a DP that, for each position i, and a current balance b, tracks two things: the maximum possible current_max up to i (the maximum depth achievable by any correct subsequence up to i) and the number of ways that this state can be achieved. However, since the maximum can change as we process the string, this might not capture the overall maximum.\n\nAlternatively, for each state (i, balance), track the maximum possible current_max that can be achieved up to that point, and the number of ways that this maximum can be achieved (sum over all possible ways of choosing the '?' up to i, and the corresponding choices in the subsequence).\n\nWait, perhaps this is feasible. The idea is to track, for each position i and current balance b, the maximum possible current_max that can be achieved when processing the first i characters, and the number of ways (count) that this maximum can be achieved. Then, when processing the next character, for each possible choice (if it's a '?'), we can split into two possibilities (replace with '(' or ')'), and for each, compute the new balance and new current_max, and accumulate the counts accordingly.\n\nBut how to handle the maximum current_max. For example, when processing the next character, the maximum current_max could either stay the same or increase.\n\nThis seems challenging. Let's try to formalize this.\n\nLet's define dp[i][b][m] as the number of ways to replace the first i '?'s (and other characters) such that after processing the first i characters, the current balance in the best possible subsequence is b, and the maximum current_max up to this point is m.\n\nWait, but the balance here refers to the balance in the chosen subsequence. However, the problem is that the subsequence is chosen to maximize the depth. So, for each replacement of the '?', the depth is the maximum over all possible subsequences. So for a given replacement, the depth is determined by the best possible subsequence (the one that gives the maximum depth).\n\nBut how to model this for all possible replacements.\n\nHmm. Perhaps the key insight is that the maximum depth for a given replacement s is equal to the maximum, over all possible prefixes of s, of (number of '(' minus number of ')' in that prefix), but only considering valid prefixes (i.e., where the balance never drops below zero). However, this is not exactly correct, because the subsequence can skip characters. So this approach may not hold.\n\nWait, but maybe not. Let's think: in order to maximize the depth, the best possible subsequence is the one that maximizes the number of open parentheses at some point. So for the entire string s, the maximum depth is the maximum over all possible positions in s, the maximum number of '(' minus ')' in a prefix that can be formed up to that position by selecting a subsequence that is a valid bracket sequence up to that point.\n\nBut how to model this for all possible s.\n\nAlternatively, for a given s, the maximum depth can be computed using a greedy approach. Let's iterate through the string, keeping track of the current balance and the maximum balance. Whenever we encounter a '(' or a '?', we can choose to treat it as '(' (to maximize the balance), and when we encounter a ')', we have to see if we can close an open parenthesis. However, this is not straightforward because '?' can be replaced as either.\n\nWait, but perhaps for a given s, the maximum depth is the maximum possible balance achieved in a valid way. So, the approach to compute it would be similar to the standard approach for the maximum depth in a correct bracket sequence, but with choices for '?'.\n\nFor example, when processing each character, we can choose whether to replace a '?' with '(' to increase the balance, or with ')', which might decrease the balance but allow more options later.\n\nBut how to choose the replacements to maximize the depth. However, in our problem, the sum is over all possible replacements, so each replacement is considered, and we need to compute the maximum depth for each, then sum all of them.\n\nSo, perhaps for each position i, and for each possible balance and current_max, track the number of ways that, considering the first i characters, the balance after processing them in the best possible subsequence is b, and the current_max up to i is m. But how to transition between states.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps we can model the problem by considering for each position i, and for each possible current balance b (in the best possible subsequence up to i), track the maximum possible current_max and the number of ways to achieve that.\n\nSo, for each i and b, we track the pair (current_max, count), where current_max is the maximum possible up to i given balance b, and count is the number of ways (replacements) that lead to this scenario.\n\nBut how to merge these pairs when transitions occur. For example, when processing the next character, which can be '(', ')', or '?', we need to consider the possibilities.\n\nLet's try to formalize this. Suppose we are at position i, with a balance b and current_max m. The number of ways for this state is dp[i][b][m]. Then, processing the next character (i+1):\n\nIf the next character is '(', then in the best possible subsequence, we would include it. Because including it increases the balance, which contributes to a higher current_max. So, the new balance is b+1, and the new current_max is max(m, b+1). So the state transitions to (b+1, max(m, b+1)) with the same count.\n\nIf the next character is ')', then to include it, we need to have b >= 1. Including it would decrease the balance to b-1. The current_max remains m. So the state transitions to (b-1, m) with the same count. However, if we choose not to include it, the state remains (b, m). But wait, since we are trying to find the best possible subsequence (the one that gives the maximum current_max), including it may or may not be better. Wait, but in the best possible subsequence, including a ')' would only be done if it helps in forming a valid sequence. But since the current_max is already tracked as the maximum up to that point, perhaps including the ')' would not increase the current_max, but may allow for more parentheses to be included later. So, the optimal choice is to include it if possible (i.e., if the balance remains >=0) to allow for more possibilities later.\n\nBut this complicates the transitions. Perhaps we need to consider all possible choices (include or exclude the character) and track the maximum current_max.\n\nAlternatively, the maximum current_max for a given s is determined by the optimal way to choose the subsequence. So, for each replacement of '?', we can model the best possible subsequence (the one that maximizes the current_max) and compute its depth.\n\nBut how to model this for all possible replacements.\n\nAn alternative approach inspired by the standard method for maximum depth in a correct bracket sequence:\n\nFor a given s, the maximum depth can be found by greedily replacing '?' with '(' when possible and then with ')', but this is not straightforward. However, this is only for the case of forming the correct sequence. For the maximum depth, perhaps the optimal way to replace '?'s is to choose '(' as much as possible in the early part to maximize the current balance, and ')' in the later part. But this is for the entire string, not for a subsequence.\n\nBut perhaps, for a given replacement of '?', the maximum depth of the sequence s is the same as the maximum number of open parentheses in any valid correct subsequence of s.\n\nWait, here's an alternative way to compute the maximum depth for a given s:\n\nThe maximum depth is the maximum number of open parentheses in any prefix of a correct subsequence of s. To find this, we can model the possible balance and track the maximum balance during the process.\n\nBut how to compute this for all possible s.\n\nAnother idea: for each position i in the original string, and for each possible current balance and current_max, track the number of ways to replace the '?' up to i such that there exists a subsequence leading to this balance and current_max. Then, the transitions would account for the possible choices of replacing the '?', and whether to include the next character in the subsequence.\n\nBut again, this seems to require tracking too many parameters.\n\nWait, perhaps for the purpose of summing over all possible replacements, the maximum depth for a replacement s is equal to the maximum possible current_max over all possible valid sequences of choices (include or exclude characters) in s, considering the replacements.\n\nBut the key is that each replacement s is considered once, and for each s, the maximum current_max over all possible subsequences of s is added to the sum.\n\nThus, the sum is the sum over all possible s (each s is a replacement of the '?') of the maximum current_max over all possible valid subsequences of s.\n\nTo model this, perhaps we can model for each position i, and possible balance b and current_max m, the number of ways to have s up to i such that the maximum current_max achievable by any subsequence of s up to i is m, and the current balance is b. Then, for the transitions, we consider the possible choices (replace '?' with '(' or ')'), and how that affects the possible subsequences.\n\nBut this is getting complicated. Let's think of it step by step.\n\nLet's model the DP as follows:\n\nFor each i in 0..n-1 (positions in the string), and for each possible balance b (open - close in the subsequence up to i), and for each possible current_max m (the maximum balance encountered in the subsequence up to i), track the number of ways that this can happen, considering the choices made for '?' up to i.\n\nInitially, at position 0 (before any characters are processed), the balance is 0 and current_max is 0, with 1 way (empty subsequence).\n\nFor each character in the string:\n\nIf the character is '(', then when processing it, we can choose to include it in the subsequence or not. But since we're trying to maximize the current_max, including it would be better if possible. However, since the sum is over all possible s (replacements of ?), perhaps we need to consider all possible ways.\n\nWait, but in this problem, the '?' can be replaced by either '(' or ')'. So for a '?', the current character can be considered as '(' or ')', each choice contributing to different possibilities in the sum.\n\nSo, for each character in the original string:\n\n- If it's '(', then the next character in s is fixed as '('. We need to process this as such in the DP.\n- If it's ')', then the next character in s is fixed as ')'. Process accordingly.\n- If it's '?', then we have two possibilities: replace with '(' or ')', each contributing to the sum.\n\nFor each of these possibilities, we need to consider whether to include the character in the subsequence or not. However, since we are looking for the maximum current_max for each s, we have to find the best possible way to include/exclude the character in the subsequence to maximize the current_max.\n\nBut how to model this in the DP, given that for each replacement choice (if it's a '?'), there are two possibilities, and for each, the best possible subsequence is considered.\n\nThis suggests that the DP needs to track the best possible parameters (balance and current_max) for each possible replacement choice, and accumulate the sum accordingly.\n\nHmm. Let's try to model the DP as follows:\n\nAt each step i, for each possible balance b and current_max m, we have a count of ways to reach this state. For the next character (i+1), depending on its type, we process it:\n\nCase 1: The next character is '(' (fixed or replaced as such):\n\nFor each state (i, b, m), we can choose to include or exclude this character in the subsequence.\n\nIncluding it:\n\n- New balance is b+1.\n- New current_max is max(m, b+1).\n- The count is added to the new state (i+1, b+1, new_current_max).\n\nExcluding it:\n\n- The state remains (i+1, b, m), with count added.\n\nBut since the maximum current_max is for the best possible subsequence, we need to choose the maximum possible current_max. However, when we exclude the character, the current_max remains m, but including it could lead to a higher m. So for the state transitions, we need to track the best possible current_max.\n\nWait, perhaps the way to model this is that for each possible state (i, b, m), when processing a '(', the best possible action is to include it (since that can increase the current_max). But if the subsequence is to be valid, the balance must not drop below zero. So, when including ')', we need to ensure that the balance after inclusion is non-negative.\n\nBut this is getting complicated. Let's think again.\n\nFor each possible replacement s of the original string, the maximum depth is the maximum possible current_max over all valid subsequences of s.\n\nThus, for each s, the maximum depth is the maximum of all possible current_max values achievable in any valid subsequence of s.\n\nSo, for the DP, we need to model for each position i, the possible balance and the current_max, along with the number of ways (s replacements) that lead to this scenario. Then, the transitions will consider the possible next characters (based on replacement choices) and whether to include them in the subsequence.\n\nBut since the maximum depth is the maximum over all possible current_max values in the DP states for the end of the string, the sum would be the sum over all DP states after processing all characters of (current_max * count).\n\nWait, perhaps not. Because for a given s, the maximum depth is the maximum current_max across all possible states (balance, current_max) at the end of processing the entire string.\n\nBut since the transitions during processing could have higher current_max values at earlier steps, we need to track the maximum current_max achieved at any point during the processing of the string.\n\nThus, the DP needs to track the current_max, which is the maximum balance up to that point in the subsequence.\n\nTherefore, the DP state must include the current_max.\n\nSo, the DP state is (i, balance, current_max), and the transitions are as follows:\n\nFor each state (i, b, m) with count c:\n\nProcess the next character (i+1):\n\nCase 1: character is '(' (either fixed or replaced as such):\n\nOption 1: include it in the subsequence.\n\nNew balance is b + 1.\n\nnew_m = max(m, b + 1).\n\nAdd to (i+1, b+1, new_m) the count c.\n\nOption 2: exclude it in the subsequence.\n\nNew balance remains b.\n\nnew_m remains m.\n\nAdd to (i+1, b, m) the count c.\n\nBut which of these options is better in terms of maximizing the current_max. For a given s, the maximum current_max is the maximum of all possible new_m values that can be achieved through any subsequence. So, when building the DP, for each replacement s, the maximum current_max is the maximum of all possible new_m values across all possible paths in the DP.\n\nBut how to model this in the DP. The problem is that for each replacement s, the maximum current_max is the maximum possible value across all possible transitions (include or exclude characters) that form a valid subsequence.\n\nThis suggests that the DP must track for each (i, b, m) the number of replacements up to i that allow for a subsequence leading to (b, m) as the maximum up to that point.\n\nBut then, when processing the next character, for each possible replacement choice (if it's a '?'), we need to consider both possibilities ( '(' and ')'), and for each, consider whether to include or exclude them.\n\nThis seems very involved. Let's think of the transitions for each possible character type.\n\nLet's proceed step by step.\n\nThe initial state is (i=0, balance=0, current_max=0) with count 1.\n\nFor each character in the string:\n\nIf the current character is '(':\n\nFor each existing state (i, b, m, cnt):\n\n- Option 1: include the '(' in the subsequence.\n\n   new_balance = b + 1\n\n   new_current_max = max(m, b + 1)\n\n   if new_balance >= 0 (which it will be since b is >=0 and we add 1), then add cnt to (i+1, new_balance, new_current_max).\n\n- Option 2: exclude the '(' in the subsequence.\n\n   new_balance remains b.\n\n   new_current_max remains m.\n\n   add cnt to (i+1, b, m).\n\nBut in this case, since we want to maximize the current_max, including the '(' is always better than excluding, as it increases the balance. However, excluding might allow for other choices later. But when considering all possible subsequences, we need to track all possibilities. But the problem is that for each replacement s, the maximum current_max is the maximum over all possible subsequences. So, the DP must account for all possible subsequences for each s and track the maximum among them.\n\nBut this seems impossible to track directly for all s. So, perhaps the solution is to model the DP as follows: for each position i, track for each possible balance b and current_max m, the number of ways to replace the '?' up to i such that there exists a subsequence of the first i characters (after replacement) that leads to balance b and current_max m. Then, the transitions will consider the possibilities for the next character (based on replacement and inclusion in the subsequence).\n\nBut this still requires tracking (i, b, m), which for n=2000 and b up to 2000, m up to 2000, could be manageable if optimized.\n\nLet's calculate the possible states. For each i (0 to 2000), b (0 to 2000), and m (0 to 2000). So for 2000 * 2000 * 2000 = 8e9 states. That's way too much.\n\nThis is not feasible. So we need a way to reduce the state.\n\nAlternative idea: notice that the current_max is the maximum balance up to i, so for a given state (i, b), the current_max can be at most max( previous_max, b). So perhaps we can find a way to track the current_max without explicitly storing it in the state.\n\nWait, for example, when including a '(', the new balance is b+1, so the new_max is max(old_max, b+1). So if we can track the current_max as the maximum of the previous current_max and the new balance, perhaps we can avoid tracking it explicitly.\n\nBut how?\n\nLet's think: the current_max is the maximum of all balances up to the current point. So for a state (i, b), the current_max must be at least b (since balance can be increased by including '('s). But when the balance is b, the current_max could be any value >= b and <= the maximum possible balance up to i.\n\nBut this is not helpful.\n\nAlternative approach inspired by the problem's sample input:\n\nThe first sample input is \"??\", which has 4 possible replacements. For each replacement, the maximum depth is calculated. The sum is 1, as only \"()\" contributes 1.\n\nIn the second sample input, the sum is 9.\n\nNow, the problem requires us to find the sum of the maximum depths for all possible replacements.\n\nAnother idea: the maximum depth for a given s is the maximum number of pairs of parentheses that can be nested. For example, in \"(()())\", there are three pairs, but the maximum depth is 2. So perhaps the maximum depth is the maximum number of open parentheses at any point in the optimal subsequence.\n\nBut how to model this.\n\nLet's consider a dynamic programming approach that tracks for each position i, the possible balance and the current maximum balance. For each possible replacement of '?', the transitions are determined, and the count of ways is tracked.\n\nBut how to manage the state transitions.\n\nHere's a revised plan:\n\nThe DP state is represented as dp[i][b][m], where:\n\n- i is the current position in the string (0-based).\n- b is the current balance (open - close) in the subsequence up to i.\n- m is the maximum balance encountered so far in the subsequence.\n\nThe value of dp[i][b][m] is the number of ways to replace the '?' in the first i characters such that there exists a subsequence of the first i characters (after replacement) with balance b and maximum balance m.\n\nThe transitions are as follows:\n\nFor each character in the original string, for each possible state (i, b, m), and for each possible replacement of the current character (if it's a '?'), we process the character and update the DP.\n\nWhen processing the next character (i+1):\n\nCase 1: The character is '('.\n\n- Replacement is fixed as '('.\n\nWe can choose to include or exclude it in the subsequence.\n\nOption 1: include it.\n\nNew balance = b + 1.\n\nNew max = max(m, b + 1).\n\nThis is only allowed if the new balance is >= 0 (which it will be, since b is >= 0).\n\nOption 2: exclude it.\n\nNew balance = b.\n\nNew max = m.\n\nSo for the next state (i+1, new_balance, new_max), we add the count.\n\nCase 2: The character is ')'.\n\n- Replacement is fixed as ')'.\n\nOption 1: include it.\n\nNew balance = b - 1.\n\nNew max = m.\n\nThis is allowed only if b >= 1 (so that the new balance is >= 0).\n\nOption 2: exclude it.\n\nNew balance = b.\n\nNew max = m.\n\nCase 3: The character is '?'.\n\n- Can be replaced as '(' or ')'.\n\nFor each replacement option:\n\nIf replaced as '(':\n\nProcess as in case 1.\n\nIf replaced as ')':\n\nProcess as in case 2.\n\nEach replacement option contributes to the count in the next state, but since we have two choices, each contributes a multiplicative factor.\n\nBut wait, for each '?', there are two possible replacements, which multiply the number of ways by 2 for each subsequent choice. So when processing a '?', each existing state (i, b, m) will split into two possibilities: one for replacing with '(', and one for ')', each contributing their own transitions.\n\nBut this will lead to an exponential number of states, which is not feasible for n=2000.\n\nWait, but the DP must track the state transitions in a way that accumulates the counts for all possible replacements. So for each '?', the transitions for both possibilities are considered, and their counts are summed.\n\nFor example, when the current character is '?', the replacement can be '(' or ')', and each choice is processed as separate cases, and their contributions are added to the next state.\n\nThus, the transitions are as follows:\n\nFor a '?', we have two possibilities: '(' and ')'.\n\nFor each possibility, we process it as per case 1 and case 2, and sum the counts.\n\nNow, the number of states is O(n^3), which for n=2000 is 8e9, which is way too big.\n\nBut perhaps we can optimize this by noting that for each i and b, the maximum m can be at most b plus the remaining characters. Or, alternatively, for a given i and b, m can be at most b plus the number of remaining '(' and '?' (if replaced as '(') that can be added.\n\nBut I'm not sure.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps we can merge the m parameter into the state by considering that m is the maximum between the current m and the new balance after including the character.\n\nBut I don't see an obvious way to reduce the state space.\n\nAlternative idea: for each state (i, b), track the maximum m that can be achieved. Because when you process the next character, the new m will be the maximum between the previous m and the new balance (if you include a '('). So, for a state (i, b), the maximum m possible is the maximum of all possible m's that can be achieved with that balance and position.\n\nThus, we can track for each (i, b) the maximum m possible, and the number of ways to achieve this. This reduces the state to (i, b), with two parameters: the maximum m and the count.\n\nWait, for example, when considering (i, b), the maximum m that can be achieved up to i with balance b is m_max. Then, when processing the next character, the new m can be either m_max (if we don't include a '(', or include a ')'), or m_max_new = max(m_max, b+1) if we include a '('.\n\nBut this approach would track for each (i, b) the maximum possible m and the count of ways to achieve that maximum m, along with possibly other m's. But if we ignore other m's and only track the maximum, then the sum may not be accurate. For example, there might be cases where some replacements lead to a higher m earlier and lower later, but others have lower m earlier and higher later. The maximum m is the highest of all.\n\nBut if we track for each (i, b) the maximum possible m and the number of ways to achieve that, then for transitions, we can only consider the maximum m and propagate that.\n\nThis could be possible. Let's formalize this.\n\nDefine dp[i][b] as a pair (max_m, count), where max_m is the maximum m achievable up to position i with balance b, and count is the number of ways to achieve this.\n\nWhen processing the next character, for each possible state (i, b), we can compute the new states (i+1, new_b) and update their max_m and counts.\n\nFor example, when processing a '(', we have two options: include or exclude.\n\nIncluding it:\n\nnew_b = b + 1\n\nnew_m = max(previous_max_m, new_b)\n\ncount remains the same.\n\nExcluding it:\n\nnew_b = b\n\nnew_m = previous_max_m\n\ncount remains the same.\n\nFor each new_b, we need to track the maximum new_m and sum the counts.\n\nSo for each state (i+1, new_b), we can track the maximum new_m from all possible transitions that reach new_b, and the sum of counts for those transitions that achieve this new_m.\n\nThis way, for each (i, b), we track the best possible m (the maximum) and accumulate the counts.\n\nThis reduces the state from (i, b, m) to (i, b), which is O(n^2), manageable for n=2000.\n\nLet's see:\n\nFor each position i, and balance b, we have:\n\nmax_m: the maximum m achievable up to i with balance b.\n\ncount: the number of ways to replace the '?' up to i and choose a subsequence that results in balance b and m being the maximum up to i.\n\nThen, when processing the next character, we consider each possible transition (include/exclude) and compute new_b and new_m.\n\nFor example, for a character '(':\n\nOption 1: include it.\n\nnew_b = b + 1.\n\nnew_m = max(max_m, new_b).\n\nThe count for this transition is the same as the previous count.\n\nOption 2: exclude it.\n\nnew_b = b.\n\nnew_m = max_m.\n\nThe count is the same.\n\nFor each new state (i+1, new_b), we update the max_m and count as follows:\n\nIf the new_m is greater than the current stored max_m in the new state, then we replace the max_m with the new_m and set the count to the current count.\n\nIf the new_m is equal to the current stored max_m, then we add the count to the existing count.\n\nIf the new_m is less than the current stored max_m, we ignore this transition.\n\nThis way, for each (i+1, new_b), we only track the maximum possible m, and sum the counts of all transitions that lead to this maximum m.\n\nThis approach effectively compresses the state by only tracking the maximum m for each balance b and position i.\n\nThis seems promising. Let's formalize the transitions:\n\nFor each character in the string:\n\nFor each possible current state (i, b) with max_m m and count c:\n\nIf the character is '(':\n\n   Option 1: include it.\n\n      new_b = b + 1\n\n      new_m = max(m, new_b)\n\n      add (new_b, new_m, c) to the transitions.\n\n   Option 2: exclude it.\n\n      new_b = b\n\n      new_m = m\n\n      add (new_b, new_m, c) to the transitions.\n\nIf the character is ')':\n\n   Option 1: include it (only possible if b > 0):\n\n      new_b = b - 1\n\n      new_m = m\n\n      add (new_b, new_m, c) to the transitions.\n\n   Option 2: exclude it:\n\n      new_b = b\n\n      new_m = m\n\n      add (new_b, new_m, c) to the transitions.\n\nIf the character is '?':\n\n   Replace with '(':\n\n      process as in the '(' case, with both include options.\n\n   Replace with ')':\n\n      process as in the ')' case, with both include options.\n\nBut wait, replacing a '?' with '(' or ')', and then for each choice, considering whether to include or exclude it.\n\nBut the replacement choice is part of the count. For example, if the current character is '?', then each replacement choice ( '(' or ')') contributes to the count by multiplying by 1, but each choice leads to different transitions.\n\nWait, no. The replacement of '?' with '(' or ')' is a choice that affects the current character. Each replacement is considered as a separate possibility, and thus the counts must be multiplied by the number of ways each choice can contribute.\n\nFor example, if the current character is '?', then each existing state (i, b) with count c contributes c * 1 to the '(' replacement case and c * 1 to the ')' replacement case. So for the '?' case, each transition is split into two separate paths: one for each replacement choice.\n\nThus, when processing a '?', we need to process both possibilities and sum the counts accordingly.\n\nBut in the state transitions, this would mean that for each '?', we have two possibilities, each contributing to the transitions.\n\nSo, the processing for a '?' is equivalent to processing '(' and ')', and summing the results.\n\nBut how to model this in the DP transitions.\n\nHere's the plan:\n\nFor each state (i, b) with max_m m and count c:\n\nWhen processing a '?', we branch into two possibilities: replacing it with '(' or ')'.\n\nFor the '(' case:\n\nProcess as per the '(' transitions.\n\nFor the ')', case:\n\nProcess as per the ')', transitions.\n\nBut for each of these cases, the count is multiplied by 1 (since each choice of replacement is a separate possibility).\n\nThus, the transitions for '?' are the sum of the transitions for '(' and ')'.\n\nBut each replacement choice is considered, and their transitions are added to the next state.\n\nThus, the DP must handle this branching.\n\nNow, putting this all together, the algorithm would be as follows:\n\nInitialize a DP table where each entry is a map from balance to a pair (max_m, count). For each position i, we track the possible balances and their max_m and count.\n\nInitialize the DP at i=0 with balance 0, max_m 0, count 1.\n\nFor each position i from 0 to n-1:\n\n   For each balance b in dp[i]:\n\n      Get the current max_m and count c.\n\n      Process the i-th character:\n\n      Case 1: character is '(':\n\n          Process include and exclude options.\n\n          For include:\n\n              new_b = b + 1\n\n              new_m = max(current_max_m, new_b)\n\n              add to dp[i+1][new_b] the new_m and c.\n\n              (compare with existing entries and update accordingly)\n\n          For exclude:\n\n              new_b = b\n\n              new_m = current_max_m\n\n              add to dp[i+1][new_b] the new_m and c.\n\n      Case 2: character is ')':\n\n          Process include and exclude options.\n\n          For include (only if b > 0):\n\n              new_b = b - 1\n\n              new_m = current_max_m\n\n              add to dp[i+1][new_b] the new_m and c.\n\n          For exclude:\n\n              new_b = b\n\n              new_m = current_max_m\n\n              add to dp[i+1][new_b] the new_m and c.\n\n      Case 3: character is '?':\n\n          Process as both '(' and ')'.\n\n          First, process the '(' replacement:\n\n              same as case 1.\n\n              each transition's count is multiplied by 1 (since this is one of the two choices).\n\n          Then, process the ')' replacement:\n\n              same as case 2.\n\n              each transition's count is multiplied by 1.\n\n          So, the transitions from the '?' are the sum of the transitions from '(' and ')'.\n\nBut in practice, since the choices are separate, for each replacement choice, we process the transitions and accumulate the counts.\n\nThe actual code will need to handle each possibility and update the DP accordingly.\n\nNow, the key is to implement this efficiently, using dynamic programming with states represented as balance and max_m, but compressed by only tracking the maximum possible m for each balance.\n\nIn code, for each step, we can represent the DP as a dictionary (or array) of balances, each mapping to a dictionary of max_m to counts. However, since this would be too slow for n=2000, we need to find a way to represent each state (balance, max_m) efficiently.\n\nBut according to our previous observation, we can track for each balance the maximum possible m and the sum of counts for that maximum m.\n\nThus, for each step i, for each balance b, we track the maximum possible m and the total count of ways to achieve that m.\n\nThis way, the DP can be represented as a list of dictionaries (one for each i), where each dictionary maps balance to (max_m, count).\n\nNow, let's think about how to implement this.\n\nIn code, for each step i, we can use a hashmap (like unordered_map in C++) to track the balance as the key, and the value is a pair (max_m, count). For each transition, we process the possible new balances and update the next step's hashmap.\n\nFor example, the initial state is:\n\ndp[0][0] = {max_m: 0, count: 1}.\n\nThen, for each character in the string, we iterate through the current state's balances, and for each, we process the possible transitions based on the character.\n\nLet's outline the code steps:\n\nInitialize a previous DP state (prev_dp), which is a map from balance to (max_m, count). Start with prev_dp containing balance 0 with (0, 1).\n\nFor each character in the input string:\n\n   Create a new current DP state (curr_dp), initially empty.\n\n   For each balance in prev_dp:\n\n      Get the current max_m and count.\n\n      Process the current character:\n\n      Depending on the character:\n\n         if it's '(':\n\n             process as two options (include and exclude)\n\n         elif it's ')':\n\n             process as two options (include and exclude)\n\n         else: // '?'\n\n             process as both '(' and ')' replacement options\n\n   After processing all transitions, set prev_dp = curr_dp for the next iteration.\n\nFinally, after processing all characters, sum over all balances in the final prev_dp of (max_m * count) for each entry.\n\nBut wait, no. Because the max_m in the final prev_dp for each balance is the maximum m achieved up to the end of the string. So the sum of (max_m * count) for all entries in prev_dp would give the total sum of depths for all possible replacements.\n\nYes. Because for each replacement, the maximum depth is the maximum m achieved in any of the possible subsequences. Since the DP tracks for each balance the maximum m achievable, the sum of (max_m * count) for all balances and their respective counts would give the desired sum.\n\nThus, the final answer is the sum of (max_m * count) for all entries in the final DP state.\n\nNow, let's think about the transitions in more detail.\n\nFor each character, the transitions are as follows:\n\nCase 1: character is '('.\n\nFor each (balance b, max_m m, count c) in prev_dp:\n\nOption 1: include the '('.\n\nnew_b = b + 1.\n\nnew_m = max(m, new_b).\n\nAdd to curr_dp[new_b]:\n\n   If curr_dp[new_b] does not exist, set it to (new_m, c).\n\n   Else, if new_m > existing max_m, set to (new_m, c).\n\n   Else if new_m == existing max_m, add c to the count.\n\nOption 2: exclude the '('.\n\nnew_b = b.\n\nnew_m = m.\n\nAdd to curr_dp[new_b] in the same way.\n\nCase 2: character is ')'.\n\nFor each (balance b, max_m m, count c) in prev_dp:\n\nOption 1: include the ')', only if b > 0.\n\nIf b > 0:\n\n   new_b = b - 1.\n\n   new_m = m.\n\n   Add to curr_dp[new_b]:\n\n      compare new_m and existing max_m for new_b, update accordingly.\n\nOption 2: exclude the ')'.\n\nnew_b = b.\n\nnew_m = m.\n\nAdd to curr_dp[new_b] in the same way.\n\nCase 3: character is '?'.\n\nThis is equivalent to processing both '(' and ')', and summing the counts.\n\nFor each (balance b, max_m m, count c) in prev_dp:\n\nProcess both possibilities:\n\nFirst, process as '(':\n\n   Option 1: include '('.\n\n      new_b = b+1, new_m = max(m, new_b).\n\n      add to curr_dp[new_b] with new_m and c.\n\n   Option 2: exclude '('.\n\n      new_b = b, new_m = m.\n\n      add to curr_dp[new_b] with new_m and c.\n\nSecond, process as ')':\n\n   Option 1: include ')', if b > 0:\n\n      new_b = b-1, new_m = m.\n\n      add to curr_dp[new_b] with new_m and c.\n\n   Option 2: exclude ')'.\n\n      new_b = b, new_m = m.\n\n      add to curr_dp[new_b] with new_m and c.\n\nBut since each replacement choice is separate, each of these transitions must be considered as contributing c to their respective new states. Thus, the total count for a given new state is the sum of c from both replacement options, but considering how they are processed.\n\nHowever, this approach leads to each replacement choice contributing to the transitions. For example, replacing '?' with '(' leads to transitions for including or excluding, and similarly for ')'.\n\nThus, for each '?', we have to process two separate possibilities (each with their own transitions) and sum their contributions.\n\nBut in code, this would mean that for a '?', we need to process each replacement option and then merge their transitions into the current DP state.\n\nThis can be done by first processing the character as '(' and then as ')', and for each, update the curr_dp accordingly. However, when processing the two replacement options, the transitions from each option must be added together (since the '?' can be replaced as either, and each contributes to the count).\n\nThus, in code, for a '?', we can process it as follows:\n\nCreate a temporary map temp_dp, which will collect the transitions from both replacement options.\n\nFirst, process the character as '(' and update temp_dp.\n\nThen, process the character as ')' and update temp_dp again.\n\nThen, merge temp_dp into curr_dp.\n\nBut how to handle this merging.\n\nAlternatively, for each replacement option, process the transitions and add them to the current curr_dp.\n\nBut this requires considering the transitions from both options and updating the curr_dp for each.\n\nFor example, when processing a '?', for each replacement option ( '(' and ')'), we process the transitions as per case 1 and case 2, and for each, add their contributions to curr_dp.\n\nBut since each replacement option is a separate choice, each contributes to the count in the curr_dp. For example, for a '?', the count from the previous state is multiplied by 1 for each replacement option, leading to a doubling of the count for that state. However, in reality, each replacement option leads to different transitions.\n\nThus, the code must handle each replacement option separately, adding their respective contributions to the curr_dp.\n\nThis suggests that for a '?', the code will process the transitions for both '(', ')', and combine their results into the curr_dp.\n\nBut how to do this without overlapping.\n\nOne way is to process the '(', then ')', and accumulate their transitions into the same curr_dp. For example, for each replacement option, process the transitions and merge them into curr_dp.\n\nIn code, this can be done by first creating a temporary map for the '(' case, then a temporary map for the ')' case, and then merge them into the curr_dp.\n\nAlternatively, process each replacement option in sequence, each time updating the curr_dp.\n\nBut for each replacement option, the transitions are handled as follows:\n\nFor the '(' replacement:\n\n   for each transition, add to curr_dp with count c (since this replacement is one of two options).\n\nFor the ')' replacement:\n\n   for each transition, add to curr_dp with count c (since this is another option).\n\nBut since each replacement is a separate choice, the counts for each transition are additive.\n\nThus, for a '?', each replacement option contributes to the transitions, and the curr_dp is updated for both possibilities.\n\nThus, in code, for a '?', the code will process the character as '(' and then as ')', adding their transitions to the curr_dp.\n\nBut the code structure would be:\n\nFor each character:\n\n   if it's '(':\n\n      process as before.\n\n   elif it's ')':\n\n      process as before.\n\n   else:\n\n      process as '(':\n\n         for all transitions (include/exclude), add to curr_dp.\n\n      process as ')':\n\n         for all transitions (include/exclude), add to curr_dp.\n\nBut wait, no. For a '?', each replacement option is processed, but each option contributes to the curr_dp with the same count c. However, each replacement option is a separate choice, so the counts are added.\n\nBut this would require that when processing a '?', each existing count c is split into two parts: one for '(' and one for ')', each contributing c to their respective transitions. Then, the curr_dp is built by combining the transitions from both possibilities.\n\nThus, in code, for a '?', the code will have to process each replacement option ( '(' and ')') and merge their transitions into the curr_dp. This can be done by first creating two temporary maps: one for the '(' case and one for the ')', then merging them into the curr_dp.\n\nBut this could be computationally expensive. Alternatively, for each replacement option, process the transitions and update the curr_dp accordingly, accumulating the counts.\n\nLet's outline this:\n\nFor a '?', for each (b, m, c) in prev_dp:\n\n   First, process the '(' replacement:\n\n      option 1: include.\n\n      new_b = b+1, new_m = max(m, new_b).\n\n      add to curr_dp.\n\n      option 2: exclude.\n\n      new_b = b, new_m = m.\n\n      add to curr_dp.\n\n   Then, process the ')' replacement:\n\n      option 1: include (if possible).\n\n      if b > 0:\n\n          new_b = b-1, new_m = m.\n\n          add to curr_dp.\n\n      option 2: exclude.\n\n          new_b = b, new_m = m.\n\n          add to curr_dp.\n\nBut for each of these, the count c is added. So, for each replacement option, the transitions are processed, and their counts are added to the curr_dp.\n\nThis way, the counts from both replacement options are summed in the curr_dp.\n\nBut how to handle this in code.\n\nIn code, the curr_dp is built by processing both possibilities and accumulating the counts. For example, for the '?' case:\n\nFor each (balance b, max_m m, count c) in prev_dp:\n\n   process as '(':\n\n      include:\n\n         new_b = b+1\n\n         new_m = max(m, new_b)\n\n         curr_dp[new_b] is updated with new_m and c.\n\n      exclude:\n\n         new_b = b\n\n         new_m = m\n\n         curr_dp[new_b] is updated with new_m and c.\n\n   process as ')':\n\n      include:\n\n         if b > 0:\n\n             new_b = b-1\n\n             new_m = m\n\n             curr_dp[new_b] is updated with new_m and c.\n\n      exclude:\n\n         new_b = b\n\n         new_m = m\n\n         curr_dp[new_b] is updated with new_m and c.\n\nThus, for each '?', each existing state (b, m, c) is processed twice: once as '(' and once as ')', and each time their transitions are added to the curr_dp.\n\nBut this would double the contribution of each existing count c. However, in reality, the '?' has two choices, and each choice contributes c to the transitions.\n\nThus, the code for the '?' case would process the character as both '(' and ')', and each time the same count c is used. This effectively adds the counts from both replacement options.\n\nThis seems correct.\n\nNow, implementing this in code requires careful handling of the transitions and merging of the counts.\n\nTo optimize for speed and memory, we can represent the DP states as a list of maps (balance to (max_m, count)), and for each step, create a new map and update it based on the previous state.\n\nIn C++, we can use an array of unordered_map<int, pair<int, int>> for each step, but given that n is up to 2000, and balance is up to 2000, using a vector of arrays may be more efficient.\n\nBut since balance can vary from 0 to up to 2000 (since each '(', when included, increases the balance by 1, and there are up to 2000 characters), we can use a fixed-size array for each step.\n\nBut for n=2000 and balance up to 2000, a 2D array of size 2000 x 2000 may be feasible.\n\nAlternatively, use a map for each step to track only the possible balances.\n\nBut given that the balance can vary up to i (current position), and i can be up to 2000, using a vector of vectors or arrays is manageable.\n\nLet's proceed.\n\nWe can represent the DP states using two arrays (prev and curr) of size MAX_BALANCE (say, 2000+1), where each entry holds the current maximum m and the count.\n\nBut since the balance can be up to 2000, for each step, we can use two arrays (prev and curr) of size 2000+1, each element being a pair (max_m, count).\n\nBut we need to reset the curr array after each step.\n\nBut in C++, for each step, we can have two arrays:\n\n- prev_balance is an array where each element is a pair (max_m, count), representing the state for a given balance after the previous step.\n\n- curr_balance is an array where each element is a pair (max_m, count), representing the state for a given balance after processing the current character.\n\nInitially, prev_balance is set to have balance 0 with max_m 0 and count 1.\n\nFor each character in the string:\n\n   Initialize curr_balance to all (-1, 0) or some invalid state.\n\n   For each balance b in prev_balance:\n\n      If prev_balance[b].count is zero, skip.\n\n      current_max_m = prev_balance[b].max_m\n\n      current_count = prev_balance[b].count\n\n      Process the character:\n\n      ...\n\n   Set prev_balance = curr_balance.\n\nBut how to efficiently iterate over the balances. Alternatively, since the maximum balance possible after i steps is i+1, for each step i, we can iterate from 0 to i+1 to check if prev_balance[b] has a count.\n\nBut this is not efficient. Instead, using a list of active balances for each step would be better.\n\nThus, for each step, we can keep a list of balances that have non-zero counts, and iterate through those.\n\nIn code:\n\nFor each step:\n\n   Create a new curr_balance array.\n\n   Iterate over all balances b in prev_balance's active list.\n\n   For each active balance b:\n\n      current_max_m = prev_balance[b].max_m\n\n      current_count = prev_balance[b].count\n\n      Process the character.\n\nThus, the code can be structured with a list of active balances for each step to avoid iterating over all possible balances.\n\nBut for the sake of code efficiency, perhaps using a vector of pairs (b, (max_m, count)) for each step would be better.\n\nBut let's proceed to code.\n\nThe code will need to handle the transitions for each character, and for each step, update the curr_balance array.\n\nThe code structure will be something like this:\n\n#include <bits/stdc++.h>\nusing namespace std;\n\nconst int MOD = 998244353;\nconst int MAXN = 2000 + 5;\n\nstruct State {\n    int max_m;\n    int count;\n    State() : max_m(0), count(0) {}\n    State(int m, int c) : max_m(m), count(c) {}\n};\n\nState prev_dp[MAXN];\nState curr_dp[MAXN];\n\nint main() {\n    string s;\n    cin >> s;\n    int n = s.size();\n\n    // Initialize prev_dp for position 0 (before any characters)\n    for (int b = 0;

For example, when processing a '?', the code processes the '(' and ')' replacements, but each replacement is considered as contributing to the curr_dp. However, in the code above, when processing the '?', the code adds the transitions for both replacements to the curr_dp, which correctly accumulates the counts for each replacement choice.\n\nBut there's a problem in the way the options are processed. For example, when processing the '?', the code first processes the '(' replacement, then the ')', and for each, their transitions are added to the same curr_dp. This way, the counts from both replacements are accumulated.\n\nBut in the code, the '?' case is handled by adding the current_count to the curr_dp's entries for both replacements. For example, the include '(' case adds current_count, and the include ')' case also adds current_count. This effectively multiplies the current_count by 2 for the '?' case, but distributed among the transitions.\n\nBut since each '?' has two choices, this is correct.\n\nAnother possible issue is the MAXN value. If the balance can go up to 2000, then setting MAXN to 2000 + 5 should be sufficient.\n\nBut let's test the code against the sample inputs.\n\nSample Input 1:\n\n??\n\nSample Output: 1.\n\nLet's trace the code:\n\nn = 2.\n\nInitial prev_dp has balance 0: max_m=0, count=1.\n\nProcessing i=0 (character '?'):\n\nFor balance 0, current_max=0, count=1.\n\nProcess as '?', which branches into '(' and ')'.\n\nFirst, process '(' replacement:\n\nOption 1: include. new_b=1, new_m=1. Add to curr_dp[1]: max_m=1, count=1.\n\nOption 2: exclude. new_b=0, new_m=0. Add to curr_dp[0]: max_m=0, count=1.\n\nThen, process ')' replacement:\n\nOption 1: include. balance 0 >0 is false. So no action.\n\nOption 2: exclude. new_b=0, new_m=0. Add to curr_dp[0]: max_m=0, count=1.\n\nSo after processing '?', curr_dp[1] is (1, 1), and curr_dp[0] is (0, 1+1=2).\n\nSo after i=0, prev_dp is:\n\nbalance 0: count 2, max_m 0.\n\nbalance 1: count 1, max_m 1.\n\nNow, processing i=1 (second '?'):\n\nFor balance 0:\n\ncurrent_max=0, count=2.\n\nProcess as '?', which branches into '(' and ')'.\n\nFirst, process '(' replacement:\n\nOption 1: include. new_b=0+1=1, new_m=max(0, 1)=1. Add to curr_dp[1] with count 2.\n\nOption 2: exclude. new_b=0, new_m=0. Add to curr_dp[0] with count 2.\n\nThen, process ')' replacement:\n\nOption 1: include. balance 0 is not >0. So no include.\n\nOption 2: exclude. new_b=0, new_m=0. Add to curr_dp[0] with count 2.\n\nSo after processing '(' replacement and ') replacement for balance 0:\n\ncurr_dp[1] has count 2 (from include '(').\n\ncurr_dp[0] has count 2 (exclude '(') + 2 (exclude ')') = 4.\n\nFor balance 1 in prev_dp (count 1, max_m 1):\n\nProcess '?', branching into '(' and ')'.\n\nFirst, process '(' replacement:\n\nOption 1: include. new_b=2, new_m=max(1, 2)=2. Add to curr_dp[2] with count 1.\n\nOption 2: exclude. new_b=1, new_m=1. Add to curr_dp[1] with count 1.\n\nThen, process ')' replacement:\n\nOption 1: include. balance 1 >0. new_b=0, new_m=1. Add to curr_dp[0] with count 1.\n\nOption 2: exclude. new_b=1, new_m=1. Add to curr_dp[1] with count 1.\n\nSo after processing balance 1:\n\ncurr_dp[2] has count 1.\n\ncurr_dp[1] gets 1 (exclude '(') + 1 (exclude ')') = 2.\n\ncurr_dp[0] gets 1 (include ') replacement).\n\nSo overall, after processing i=1:\n\ncurr_dp[0] has max_m max between:\n\n- from balance 0: max_m 0 (from exclude '(' and ')'), count 4 + 1 = 5? Wait, no. Let's re-examine:\n\nFor the first '?', balance 0:\n\nAfter processing '(' replacement:\n\ninclude: new_b=1, count 1.\n\nexclude: new_b=0, count 1.\n\nThen ') replacement:\n\nexclude: new_b=0, count 1.\n\nSo after i=0, balance 0 has count 2.\n\nAt i=1, processing balance 0:\n\nprocessing '?':\n\nFor '(' replacement:\n\ninclude: new_b=1, new_m=1. curr_dp[1] is updated to count 2.\n\nexclude: new_b=0, new_m=0. curr_dp[0] gets count 2.\n\nFor ') replacement:\n\nexclude: new_b=0, new_m=0. curr_dp[0] gets count 2+2=4? Or is it additive?\n\nNo. Let's trace the code for balance 0:\n\ncurrent_count is 2.\n\nProcessing '?', first for '(' replacement:\n\ninclude:\n\ncurr_dp[1] is updated to max_m 1, count 2.\n\nexclude:\n\ncurr_dp[0] is updated to max_m 0, count 2.\n\nThen for ') replacement:\n\ninclude is not possible (balance 0).\n\nexclude:\n\ncurr_dp[0] is updated. Since curr_dp[0] already has max_m 0 and count 2 from the exclude of '(', adding the current_count 2 for exclude of ')', so curr_dp[0] count becomes 2 (from ') replacement exclude) + previous 2 (from '(' exclude) = 4? Or is it added?\n\nYes. For the first exclude of '(', the curr_dp[0] is updated to count 2. Then, for the ') replacement exclude, the code again adds current_count (2) to curr_dp[0], so the count becomes 2 + 2 = 4.\n\nThen, for balance 1 in prev_dp (count 1):\n\nprocessing '?', first '(' replacement:\n\ninclude: new_b=2, count 1.\n\nexclude: new_b=1, count 1.\n\nThen ') replacement:\n\ninclude: new_b=0, count 1.\n\nexclude: new_b=1, count 1.\n\nSo after processing balance 1:\n\ncurr_dp[2] has count 1.\n\ncurr_dp[1] has count 1 (from exclude '(') + 1 (from exclude ')') = 2.\n\ncurr_dp[0] has count 1 (from include ') replacement).\n\nBut the existing curr_dp[0] was already 4 from balance 0 processing. So after processing balance 1, curr_dp[0] is updated to max_m 1 (from include ') replacement) and count 1. However, previous curr_dp[0] had max_m 0 and count 4. So, when adding the new state (max_m 1, count 1), since 1 > 0, the curr_dp[0] is updated to max_m 1, count 1. The previous count of 4 is ignored because the max_m was lower.\n\nSo after processing balance 1:\n\ncurr_dp[0] has max_m 1 and count 1.\n\ncurr_dp[1] has max_m 1 and count 2.\n\ncurr_dp[2] has max_m 2 and count 1.\n\nThus, after processing i=1, the final curr_dp has:\n\nbalance 0: max_m 1, count 1.\n\nbalance 1: max_m 1, count 2.\n\nbalance 2: max_m 2, count 1.\n\nThe sum is:\n\n1*1 (balance 0) + 1*2 (balance 1) + 2*1 (balance 2) = 1 + 2 + 2 = 5. But the sample output is 1.\n\nThis indicates a mistake in the code logic.\n\nHmm, this suggests that the code is not correctly tracking the maximum m for each replacement s.\n\nBut why?\n\nLet's think again about the first sample input.\n\nThe first sample input is \"??\". The possible replacements are:\n\n1. \"((\", which has depth 0.\n\n2. \"()\", which has depth 1.\n\n3. \")(\", which has depth 0.\n\n4. \"))\", which has depth 0.\n\nThus, the sum is 1.\n\nBut according to the code's calculation, the sum is 1*1 + 1*2 + 2*1 = 5, which is incorrect.\n\nThis indicates a flaw in the approach.\n\nThe problem is that the code is summing the max_m of each balance in the final state, but the max_m for each balance represents the maximum m achieved in any possible subsequence for that particular balance. However, the correct approach should compute the maximum m across all possible subsequences and all possible balances for each replacement s.\n\nThe code currently sums the max_m for each balance, but for a single replacement s, the maximum depth is the maximum of all possible m's across all balances. However, the current code's approach sums the max_m for each balance, which counts the max_m for each individual balance, not the overall maximum.\n\nThis is the critical mistake.\n\nFor example, in the first sample input, the replacement \"()\" would have a maximum depth of 1. This corresponds to a balance of 1 after the first '(', then balance 0 after the ')', but the max_m is 1. The code's final state would have balance 0 and max_m 1 (from including both characters). But other balances may have higher max_m.\n\nHowever, the code's approach assumes that each balance's max_m is the maximum possible for that particular balance, but the overall maximum for a given s is the maximum of all possible max_m's across all balances in the DP states for that s.\n\nThus, the code's approach is incorrect. The sum computed by the code is the sum of max_m for each balance multiplied by their counts, but this is not the same as the sum of the maximum m for each s.\n\nThis is a fundamental flaw in the approach.\n\nThe key mistake is that for each s, the maximum depth is the maximum of all possible m's across all possible balances in the final DP states for that s. The code's current approach sums the m's of each balance, but this is not correct.\n\nFor example, for a particular s, the final DP states may have multiple balances with various m's. The maximum depth for s is the maximum of all these m's. But the code's approach treats each balance's m as a separate contribution and sums them, which overcounts.\n\nThus, the entire approach is incorrect.\n\nWe need to find a way to track the maximum m across all balances for each s.\n\nThis suggests that the previous approach of tracking for each balance the maximum m is not sufficient. Instead, we need to track for each s the maximum m achieved in any balance.\n\nBut how to model this.\n\nAlternative approach: the maximum m for a given s is the maximum of all possible m's across all balances in the final DP states for that s. So, for each s, the depth is this maximum.\n\nThus, the sum over all s is the sum of the maximum m for each s.\n\nBut how to model this in the DP.\n\nThis seems challenging. However, perhaps we can track for each state (i, b) the maximum m achieved up to i, and also track the overall maximum m for the entire string up to i.\n\nBut this brings us back to tracking three parameters (i, b, m), which is not feasible for n=2000.\n\nAlternative idea: For each state (i, b), track the maximum m that can be achieved up to i, and also track the overall maximum m across all balances up to i.\n\nBut this would require tracking for each (i, b) the maximum m and the cumulative maximum m up to i.\n\nFor example, the DP state can track for each balance b the maximum m up to i, and the global maximum m up to i.\n\nBut how to propagate this global maximum.\n\nAlternatively, for each state (i, b), track the maximum m up to i, and also track the maximum m across all balances up to i.\n\nBut this again introduces a new parameter (the global maximum up to i), leading to a state space of (i, b, global_max), which is again O(n^3).\n\nBut perhaps we can find that the global_max is non-decreasing, allowing us to track it in a compressed way.\n\nFor example, the global maximum m can only increase or stay the same as we process each character. Thus, for each state (i, b), we can track the current maximum m, and the global maximum up to i.\n\nBut this still requires tracking two m parameters.\n\nAlternatively, for each state (i, b), track the maximum m achievable up to i for that balance, and the maximum m across all balances up to i.\n\nThis would allow us to compute the sum as the sum of the maximum m's for each s.\n\nBut the state is now (i, b, m, global_m), which is even larger.\n\nThis seems impractical.\n\nThus, we need a different approach.\n\nAlternative idea inspired by the problem's solution for the maximum depth:\n\nThe maximum depth for a given s is the maximum number of pairs of nested parentheses in any valid subsequence of s. This can be determined by finding the maximum number of opening brackets '(' that can be balanced by closing brackets ')', and the maximum depth is the maximum number of '(' at any point during the subsequence.\n\nBut how to model this for all possible s.\n\nLet's think of the problem in terms of choosing for each '?' whether to replace it with '(' or ')', and then compute the maximum depth for each s.\n\nBut for each s, the maximum depth is determined by the maximum number of consecutive '(' followed by ')', but this is not precisely correct.\n\nAnother approach is to use dynamic programming to track for each position i, the possible balance and the maximum balance encountered so far. But again, this is what the previous code attempted, but it's incorrect.\n\nWait, perhaps the previous code was correct, but the way the sum is computed is wrong. For example, the code's final sum is the sum of max_m * count for each balance. However, this counts the max_m for each balance separately. But for each s, the maximum depth is the maximum of all max_m's across all balances for that s.\n\nThus, the code's approach is incorrect because it sums the max_m for each balance, but the correct sum should be the sum of the maximum max_m for each s.\n\nThus, the code's current approach overcounts. For example, a single s may contribute to multiple balances, but the code's current approach adds all of their max_m's, whereas the correct contribution is the maximum of those max_m's.\n\nThus, the code is incorrect.\n\nThis suggests that the problem requires a different approach.\n\nAlternative approach: For each s, the maximum depth is the maximum number of '(' in any prefix of a valid subsequence of s. Thus, the problem reduces to finding, for each s, the maximum number of '(' that can be included in a valid sequence, with the constraint that the balance never drops below zero.\n\nBut how to model this for all s.\n\nThis seems similar to the classic problem of finding the maximum number of '(' that can be included in a valid subsequence, but with the option to replace '?' with '(' or ')'.\n\nBut summing this over all possible s.\n\nLet's think of this as follows:\n\nFor each s, the maximum depth is the maximum number of '(' that can be included in a valid subsequence of s. We need to sum this over all possible s.\n\nBut how to model this.\n\nWe can model the problem using dynamic programming where for each position i and balance b, we track the maximum number of '(' (which contributes to the depth) and the number of ways to achieve that.\n\nBut this requires tracking the maximum number of '(' in the valid subsequence up to i with balance b.\n\nThis is a classic approach for problems involving maximizing a certain parameter in a valid sequence.\n\nThus, for each state (i, b), we track two things:\n\n- the maximum number of '(' that can be included up to i with balance b.\n\n- the number of ways to achieve that maximum.\n\nAdditionally, we need to track the sum of the maximum number of '(' for all s.\n\nBut how to model this.\n\nThe key is that the maximum number of '(' is the depth. Thus, for each state (i, b), the maximum number of '(' is the maximum possible up to that point, and the sum is the sum of these maximums for all s.\n\nBut how.\n\nLet's think:\n\nFor each position i, and balance b, we track two values:\n\n- max_open: the maximum number of '(' in any valid subsequence up to i with balance b.\n\n- count: the number of ways to achieve this max_open.\n\nThen, for each character, we process transitions as follows:\n\nFor each possible state (i, b):\n\n   If the current character is '(' or replaced as '(':\n\n      option to include it:\n\n         new_b = b + 1.\n\n         new_open = max_open + 1.\n\n         if new_b >=0:\n\n             update the new state (i+1, new_b) with new_open and count.\n\n      option to exclude it:\n\n         new_b = b.\n\n         new_open = max_open.\n\n         update the new state (i+1, new_b) with new_open and count.\n\n   If the character is ')' or replaced as ')':\n\n      option to include it:\n\n         new_b = b - 1.\n\n         new_open = max_open.\n\n         if new_b >=0:\n\n             update the new state (i+1, new_b) with new_open and count.\n\n      option to exclude it:\n\n         new_b = b.\n\n         new_open = max_open.\n\n         update the new state (i+1, new_b) with new_open and count.\n\nFor each state (i, b), we track the maximum max_open and the count of ways to achieve it.\n\nThe final answer is the sum over all final states (balance 0 to n) of (max_open * count), but only the maximum max_open for each s is considered.\n\nBut wait, no. Because for each s, the maximum depth is the maximum max_open across all balances in the final state. Thus, the sum is the sum over all s of (max_depth(s)), where max_depth(s) is the maximum max_open across all balances in the final state for s.\n\nBut how to compute this.\n\nThis seems to require tracking for each s the maximum max_open across all possible balances, but how to model this in the DP.\n\nAn alternative approach is to realize that the maximum max_open for a given s is the maximum of all max_open values across all balances in the final state for s.\n\nThus, to compute the sum, we need to consider for each possible s the maximum max_open across all balances and sum those.\n\nBut this again requires tracking the maximum max_open for each s, which is challenging.\n\nAn alternative idea: during the DP, track for each state (i, b) the maximum max_open and the count of ways to achieve it. Then, also track the maximum max_open up to the current position.\n\nBut this is not straightforward.\n\nAnother approach inspired by the fact that the maximum depth is the maximum number of open parentheses in any valid subsequence:\n\nThe maximum depth for s is the maximum number of open parentheses in any valid subsequence of s. For each s, this is equivalent to the maximum number of '(' that can be included in a valid sequence of s.\n\nThus, the problem reduces to summing the maximum number of '(' possible in any valid subsequence of s, for each s.\n\nThis is a different way to model the problem, but it's equivalent to the original definition.\n\nThus, the DP should track the maximum number of '(' in valid subsequences for each possible s.\n\nLet's model this with dynamic programming:\n\nFor each position i, and balance b, track:\n\n- the maximum number of '(' in any valid subsequence up to i with balance b.\n\n- the number of ways to achieve this maximum.\n\nThis way, the maximum depth for a given s is the maximum max_open across all balances in the final state.\n\nThus, the sum is the sum of (max_open(s) * count(s)), where max_open(s) is the maximum max_open across all balances for s, and count(s) is the number of ways to achieve s.\n\nBut how to compute this.\n\nThis requires that for each s, we find the maximum max_open across all balances and sum those.\n\nBut again, this seems challenging.\n\nBut perhaps we can track for each state (i, b) the maximum max_open and the count, and also track the global maximum up to i.\n\nThus, for each state (i, b), we can also track the global maximum up to i, but this increases the state space.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps we can track for each state (i, b) the maximum max_open and the count, and also track the current global maximum for each s.\n\nBut this again is not feasible.\n\nAnother idea: since the maximum max_open for s is the maximum of all max_open in the final states for s, perhaps we can model the DP to track the maximum max_open up to the current position, along with the balance.\n\nBut this requires tracking the current maximum max_open and the balance.\n\nThus, the state would be (i, b, m), where m is the maximum max_open up to i. This brings us back to a three-dimensional state, which is O(n^3) and feasible for n=2000.\n\nBut let's see:\n\nFor each position i, balance b, and max_open m, track the number of ways to reach this state.\n\nThen, when processing the next character, for each possible state, we can transition to new states based on including or excluding the character, and update the max_open accordingly.\n\nThe sum of max_open for each s is then the sum of m * count for each state in the final step where m is the maximum possible for that s.\n\nBut how to track the maximum m for each s.\n\nThis approach seems more promising.\n\nLet's outline the transitions:\n\nInitialize the DP as follows:\n\ndp[0][0][0] = 1.\n\nFor each character in the string:\n\n   For each state (i, b, m) with count c:\n\n      Process the current character:\n\n      If the character is '(':\n\n         Option 1: include it.\n\n             new_b = b + 1.\n\n             new_m = m + 1.\n\n             if new_b >= 0, then add c to dp[i+1][new_b][new_m].\n\n         Option 2: exclude it.\n\n             new_b = b.\n\n             new_m = m.\n\n             add c to dp[i+1][new_b][new_m].\n\n      If the character is ')':\n\n         Option 1: include it (if b > 0):\n\n             new_b = b - 1.\n\n             new_m = m.\n\n             add c to dp[i+1][new_b][new_m].\n\n         Option 2: exclude it.\n\n             new_b = b.\n\n             new_m = m.\n\n             add c to dp[i+1][new_b][new_m].\n\n      If the character is '?':\n\n         Process both '(' and ')' cases:\n\n         For '(' replacement:\n\n             include: new_b = b + 1, new_m = m + 1. Add c to dp[i+1][new_b][new_m].\n\n             exclude: new_b = b, new_m = m. Add c to dp[i+1][new_b][new_m].\n\n         For ')' replacement:\n\n             include: if b > 0, new_b = b-1, new_m = m. Add c to dp[i+1][new_b][new_m].\n\n             exclude: new_b = b, new_m = m. Add c to dp[i+1][new_b][new_m].\n\nBut this approach requires a three-dimensional DP (i, b, m), which for i up to 2000, b up to 2000, and m up to 2000, would be 2000 * 2000 * 2000 = 8e9 states. This is not feasible in terms of memory and time.\n\nThus, this approach is not feasible.\n\nAlternative Idea: Note that m can't exceed the current balance + the number of remaining characters. But even with this optimization, it's still not feasible.\n\nAnother Idea: The maximum possible m is the number of '(' in the current subsequence. For a valid subsequence, the maximum m is the maximum number of '(' that can be present in any valid subsequence.\n\nBut this is exactly what the problem requires. So, perhaps the maximum m for a given s is the maximum number of '(' in any valid subsequence of s.\n\nThus, the problem reduces to summing the maximum number of '(' in any valid subsequence of s, for all s.\n\nThus, we can model the DP to track for each position i and balance b, the maximum number of '(' (m) and the count of ways to achieve that.\n\nBut again, the state is (i, b, m), which is O(n^3), not feasible.\n\nBut perhaps we can optimize by tracking for each (i, b) the maximum possible m and the count of ways to achieve that.\n\nThus, for each (i, b), track the best possible m and the count.\n\nThis reduces the state to O(n^2), which is manageable.\n\nThus, for each (i, b), track the maximum m (number of '(') achievable up to i with balance b, and the count of ways to achieve that.\n\nThen, transitions are:\n\nFor each character:\n\n   if it's '(', then include or exclude:\n\n      include: new_b = b + 1, new_m = current_m + 1.\n\n      exclude: new_b = b, new_m = current_m.\n\n   if it's ')', include or exclude:\n\n      include: new_b = b-1, new_m = current_m (only if b >0).\n\n      exclude: new_b = b, new_m = current_m.\n\n   if it's '?', process both possibilities.\n\nAt each step, for each (i, b), track the best m and count.\n\nThe maximum m for a given s is the maximum m across all balances in the final state.\n\nThus, after processing all characters, the sum is the sum of the maximum m for each s.\n\nBut how to compute this.\n\nThe maximum m for each s is the maximum m among all balances in the final DP states for that s.\n\nBut each s corresponds to a unique path through the replacement choices (for '?'), and each path leads to certain DP states. For each such path, the maximum m is the maximum m among all balances in the final DP states for that path.\n\nBut it's impossible to track this directly for all s.\n\nThus, this approach also does not solve the problem.\n\nAlternative Idea inspired by the problem's note that the depth is the maximum over all possible correct subsequences. So for each s, the maximum depth is the maximum number of '(' in any valid subsequence of s.\n\nThus, the sum required is the sum over all s of the maximum number of '(' in any valid subsequence of s.\n\nThus, the problem reduces to the sum of the maximum number of '(' in any valid subsequence of s for each s.\n\nThis is a different perspective. How can we compute this sum?\n\nLet's think of the problem as follows: for each possible replacement s, compute the maximum number of '(' in any valid subsequence of s, and sum these values.\n\nThis can be modeled with dynamic programming.\n\nFor each position i and balance b, track the maximum number of '(' (m) in a valid subsequence up to i with balance b, and the number of ways to achieve this.\n\nThe transitions are similar to the previous approaches.\n\nBut how to model the sum of the maximum m's for each s.\n\nThe key insight is that for each s, the maximum m is the maximum of all m's across all possible balances in the final state. Thus, to compute the sum, we need to track for each s the maximum m, which is the maximum over all balances for that s.\n\nBut how to compute this in the DP.\n\nAn alternative idea: during the DP, for each state (i, b, m), track the count of s up to i that lead to this state, and track the maximum m for each s.\n\nBut this is again O(n^3), which is not feasible.\n\nThus, this suggests that the problem requires a different approach.\n\nAnother Idea: Since the maximum m for each s is the maximum of all m's in the final state for s, perhaps we can model the DP to track for each state (i, b) the maximum m up to i and the sum of counts multiplied by their maximum m's.\n\nBut how.\n\nFor each state (i, b), track the maximum m that can be achieved up to i with balance b, and the sum of counts multiplied by the maximum m's for all paths leading to this state.\n\nBut this is not clear.\n\nAlternatively, for each state (i, b), track two things:\n\n- the maximum m achievable up to i with balance b.\n\n- the sum of counts multiplied by the maximum m for each path leading to this state.\n\nBut how to propagate this sum.\n\nAt each step, when processing a character, for each possible transition to a new state (i+1, new_b), the sum for that state would be the sum of counts from the previous state multiplied by the new m (if it's the maximum), plus existing sums.\n\nThis seems complicated.\n\nBut let's try to model this:\n\nDefine for each state (i, b):\n\n- max_m: the maximum number of '(' achievable up to i with balance b.\n\n- sum: the sum of (max_m * count) for all paths leading to this state.\n\nThus, the transitions would process each character, and for each possible transition to a new state, update the new state's max_m and sum accordingly.\n\nFor example, when processing a '(', for a state (i, b) with max_m m and sum s:\n\nIncluding the '(':\n\nnew_b = b+1.\n\nnew_m = m + 1.\n\nThe sum for the new state (i+1, new_b) is increased by s * new_m (if new_m is the new max_m for that state).\n\nBut this is not correct because the sum is supposed to be the sum of max_m for each s.\n\nThus, this approach may not work.\n\nAnother Idea: For each state (i, b), track the number of paths (count) and the sum of the maximum m's for those paths.\n\nThis sum of maximum m's is the sum of the maximum m's for each s that reaches this state. For example, if two paths reach (i, b) with max m=3 and m=4, their sum would be 3 + 4 =7.\n\nBut how to track this.\n\nThus, the DP state would track:\n\n- max_m: the maximum m achievable up to i with balance b.\n\n- count: the number of paths leading to this state.\n\n- sum_m: the sum of the maximum m's for each path leading to this state.\n\nThe transitions would then:\n\nFor each character, for each state (i, b), and for each possible transition:\n\n   compute the new_b and new_m.\n\n   if new_m is greater than the current max_m in the new state (i+1, new_b):\n\n       update the max_m to new_m.\n\n       set sum_m to current sum_m (from the previous state) + new_m * count.\n\n       set count to the current count.\n\n   elif new_m is equal to the current max_m:\n\n       add current sum_m to the new sum_m.\n\n       add current count to the new count.\n\n   else:\n\n       do nothing.\n\nThus, for each state (i+1, new_b), the sum_m would accumulate the sum of maximum m's for all paths leading to it.\n\nAt the end, the sum of sum_m for all balances in the final state would give the desired sum.\n\nThis seems promising.\n\nLet's outline this approach:\n\nFor each state (i, b), we track:\n\n- max_m: the maximum m achievable for paths leading to this state.\n\n- count: the number of paths leading to this state.\n\n- sum_m: the sum of max_m for each of these paths.\n\nThe transitions would be:\n\nWhen processing a character, for each state (i, b), and for each possible transition (include or exclude):\n\n   compute new_b and new_m.\n\n   for the new state (i+1, new_b):\n\n      if new_m > current max_m of new state:\n\n          new_state's max_m = new_m\n\n          new_state's sum_m = current sum_m (from previous state) + new_m * count.\n\n          new_state's count = count.\n\n      elif new_m == current max_m of new state:\n\n          new_state's sum_m += sum_m (from previous state) + new_m * count.\n\n          new_state's count += count.\n\n      else:\n\n          new_state's sum_m += sum_m (from previous state).\n\n          new_state's count += count.\n\nBut this is not correct, because the sum_m should only include the max_m for each path, not add the sum_m from previous transitions.\n\nAlternatively, when transitioning, the sum_m for the new state is the sum of the max_m's of all paths leading to it. Thus, for each path leading to (i, b), when transitioning to (i+1, new_b) with new_m, the sum_m for (i+1, new_b) is increased by new_m multiplied by the number of paths (count) from (i, b), provided that new_m is the maximum for (i+1, new_b).\n\nBut this requires careful handling.\n\nHere's the correct approach:\n\nFor each transition from (i, b) to (i+1, new_b):\n\n   new_m is the max_m of (i, b) plus 1 if the character is included as '(', or same as (i, b)'s max_m if included as ')'.\n\nWait, no. The new_m depends on whether the character is included or excluded.\n\nFor example, if the character is '(', including it increases the m by 1 (as m is the number of '(' in the subsequence). Excluding it leaves m unchanged.\n\nThus, for each transition, the new_m is either m+1 (if included and character is '(') or m (if excluded or character is ')')).\n\nThus, for each state (i, b), the transitions would generate new_m values based on the character and whether it's included.\n\nThen, for each new state (i+1, new_b), we need to track all possible new_m values and their counts and sum of new_m.\n\nBut this brings us back to tracking (i, b, m), which is not feasible.\n\nThus, this approach is not feasible.\n\nThis suggests that the problem requires a completely different approach.\n\nAnother Idea: The maximum depth for a given s is the maximum number of '(' in any valid subsequence of s. So, for each possible number of '(' k, compute the number of s where the maximum number of '(' in any valid subsequence of s is k. Then, sum k multiplied by the number of such s.\n\nThus, the problem can be transformed into counting the number of s for which the maximum k is achieved, for each k.\n\nBut how to compute this.\n\nThe maximum k is the largest number such that there exists a valid subsequence of s with k '(', and no valid subsequence with k+1 '('.\n\nBut this seems difficult to model.\n\nAlternative Idea inspired by linearity of expectation: The sum of the maximum depth over all s is equal to the sum over all possible positions in s of the probability that a certain character is included in the maximum depth's contributing sequence.\n\nBut this is not clear.\n\nAlternative Idea: For each '(', whether it's part of the maximum depth's subsequence for some s.

Indeed, treating $$$+1$$$ as true and $$$-1$$$ as false, we have clauses of length $$$3$$$, and we need at least $$$2$$$ of the variables to be true.\nWe can reduce this to 2-SAT with the following observation: at least $$$2$$$ of $$$(x,y,z)$$$ are true $$$\\iff$$$ at least one of $$$(x,y)$$$ is true, at least one of $$$(y,z)$$$ is true, and at least one of $$$(z,x)$$$ is true. That is, for each column of the grid, we make three 2-SAT clauses. Then we just run 2-SAT on these clauses, and output if there is a solution. The time complexity is $$$\\mathcal{O}(n)$$$ per test case.\nIt might be time-consuming to code 2-SAT during the contest, so we recommend using some standard library (for example, our solution uses AtCoder library).\n",

In the classroom there are n lanes of m desks each, and there are two working places at each of the desks. The lanes are numbered from 1 to n from the left to the right, the desks in a lane are numbered from 1 to m starting from the blackboard. Note that the lanes go perpendicularly to the blackboard, not along it (see picture).\n\nThe organizers numbered all the working places from 1 to 2nm. The places are numbered by lanes (i. e. all the places of the first lane go first, then all the places of the second lane, and so on), in a lane the places are numbered starting from the nearest to the blackboard (i. e. from the first desk in the lane), at each desk, the place on the left is numbered before the place on the right.\n\nThe picture illustrates the first and the second samples.\n\nSanta Clause knows that his place has number k. Help him to determine at which lane at which desk he should sit, and whether his place is on the left or on the right!\n\n## Constraints\nTime limit per test: 2.0 seconds\nMemory limit per test: 256.0 megabytes\n\n## Input Format\nThe only line contains three integers n, m and k (1 ≤ n, m ≤ 10 000, 1 ≤ k ≤ 2nm) — the number of lanes, the number of desks in each lane and the number of Santa Claus' place.\n\n## Output Format\nPrint two integers: the number of lane r, the number of desk d, and a character s, which stands for the side of the desk Santa Claus. The character s should be \"L\", if Santa Clause should sit on the left, and \"R\" if his place is on the right.\n\n## Examples\n```input\n4 3 9\n```\n```output\n2 2 L\n```\n-----\n```input\n4 3 24\n```\n```output\n4 3 R\n```\n-----\n```input\n2 4 4\n```\n```output\n1 2 R\n```\n\n## Note\nThe first and the second samples are shown on the picture. The green place corresponds to Santa Claus' place in the first example, the blue place corresponds to Santa Claus' place in the second example.\n\nIn the third sample there are two lanes with four desks in each, and Santa Claus has the fourth place. Thus, his place is in the first lane at the second desk on the right.\n\n## Editorial\nIt can be easily seen that the side on which Santa should sit depends only on the parity of k, while the number of desk and the number of lane depend only on a value $$p = \\left\\lfloor \\frac{k-1}{2} \\right\\rfloor$$. We can see that in such numeration the number of lane equals $$\\left\\lfloor \\frac{p}{m} \\right\\rfloor + 1$$, while the number of desk equals $$p \\bmod m + 1$$.\n",

In each query, you are given a vertex of the tree $$$v$$$ and an integer $$$k$$$.\n\nTo process a query, you may delete any vertices from the tree in any order, except for the root and the vertex $$$v$$$. When a vertex is deleted, its children become the children of its parent. You have to process a query in such a way that maximizes the value of $$$c(v) - m \\cdot k$$$ (where $$$c(v)$$$ is the resulting number of children of the vertex $$$v$$$, and $$$m$$$ is the number of vertices you have deleted). Print the maximum possible value you can obtain.\n\nThe queries are independent: the changes you make to the tree while processing a query don't affect the tree in other queries.\n\nExecution time limit: 6.0 seconds\nMemory limit: 512.0 MB\n\n## Input Format\nThe first line contains one integer $$$n$$$ ($$$1 \\le n \\le 2 \\cdot 10^5$$$) — the number of vertices in the tree.\n\nThen $$$n-1$$$ lines follow, the $$$i$$$-th of them contains two integers $$$x_i$$$ and $$$y_i$$$ ($$$1 \\le x_i, y_i \\le n$$$; $$$x_i \\ne y_i$$$) — the endpoints of the $$$i$$$-th edge. These edges form a tree.\n\nThe next line contains one integer $$$q$$$ ($$$1 \\le q \\le 2 \\cdot 10^5$$$) — the number of queries.\n\nThen $$$q$$$ lines follow, the $$$j$$$-th of them contains two integers $$$v_j$$$ and $$$k_j$$$ ($$$1 \\le v_j \\le n$$$; $$$0 \\le k_j \\le 2 \\cdot 10^5$$$) — the parameters of the $$$j$$$-th query.\n\n## Output Format\nFor each query, print one integer — the maximum value of $$$c(v) - m \\cdot k$$$ you can achieve.\n\n## Examples\n```input\n8\n6 7\n3 2\n8 3\n5 7\n7 4\n7 1\n7 3\n6\n1 0\n1 2\n1 3\n7 1\n5 0\n7 200000\n```\n```output\n5\n2\n1\n4\n0\n4\n```\n\n## Note\nThe tree in the first example is shown in the following picture:\n\nAnswers to the queries are obtained as follows:\n\n1. $$$v=1,k=0$$$: you can delete vertices $$$7$$$ and $$$3$$$, so the vertex $$$1$$$ has $$$5$$$ children (vertices $$$2$$$, $$$4$$$, $$$5$$$, $$$6$$$, and $$$8$$$), and the score is $$$5 - 2 \\cdot 0 = 5$$$;\n2. $$$v=1,k=2$$$: you can delete the vertex $$$7$$$, so the vertex $$$1$$$ has $$$4$$$ children (vertices $$$3$$$, $$$4$$$, $$$5$$$, and $$$6$$$), and the score is $$$4 - 1 \\cdot 2 = 2$$$.\n3. $$$v=1,k=3$$$: you shouldn't delete any vertices, so the vertex $$$1$$$ has only one child (vertex $$$7$$$), and the score is $$$1 - 0 \\cdot 3 = 1$$$;\n4. $$$v=7,k=1$$$: you can delete the vertex $$$3$$$, so the vertex $$$7$$$ has $$$5$$$ children (vertices $$$2$$$, $$$4$$$, $$$5$$$, $$$6$$$, and $$$8$$$), and the score is $$$5 - 1 \\cdot 1 = 4$$$;\n5. $$$v=5,k=0$$$: no matter what you do, the vertex $$$5$$$ will have no children, so the score is $$$0$$$;\n6. $$$v=7,k=200000$$$: you shouldn't delete any vertices, so the vertex $$$7$$$ has $$$4$$$ children (vertices $$$3$$$, $$$4$$$, $$$5$$$, and $$$6$$$), and the score is $$$4 - 0 \\cdot 200000 = 4$$$.\n",

Given the constraints (n up to \\(10^9\\) and k up to \\(10^6\\)), a direct computation is infeasible. Instead, we use mathematical insights and properties of modular arithmetic to derive an efficient solution.\n\n### Approach\nThe sum of the k-th powers can be expressed using Faulhaber's formula, which involves Bernoulli numbers. However, due to the high constraints, we use a different approach leveraging the properties of modular arithmetic and polynomial evaluation.\n\n1. **Polynomial Representation**: The sum \\( S(n, k) = 1^k + 2^k + \\ldots + n^k \\) can be represented as a polynomial of degree \\( k+1 \\).\n2. **Modular Arithmetic**: Using properties of modular arithmetic, we can efficiently compute large powers and modular inverses.\n3. **Dynamic Programming**: We use dynamic programming to precompute necessary values and efficiently compute the sum.\n\n### Solution Code\n```cpp\n#include <bits/stdc++.h>\nusing namespace std;\n\nconst int MOD = 1e9 + 7;\n\nint mod_inv(int a, int m = MOD) {\n    int m0 = m, y = 0, x = 1;\n    if (m == 1) return 0;\n    while (a > 1) {\n        int q = a / m;\n        int t = m;\n        m = a % m, a = t;\n        t = y;\n        y = x - q * y;\n        x = t;\n    }\n    if (x < 0) x += m0;\n    return x;\n}\n\nint pow_mod(int a, int b, int m = MOD) {\n    int res = 1;\n    a %= m;\n    while (b) {\n        if (b & 1) res = 1LL * res * a % m;\n        a = 1LL * a * a % m;\n        b >>= 1;\n    }\n    return res;\n}\n\nint main() {\n    ios_base::sync_with_stdio(false);\n    cin.tie(nullptr);\n    \n    int n, k;\n    cin >> n >> k;\n    \n    if (k == 0) {\n        cout << n % MOD << '\\n';\n        return 0;\n    }\n    \n    vector<int> inv(k + 2);\n    inv[1] = 1;\n    for (int i = 2; i <= k + 1; ++i) {\n        inv[i] = MOD - 1LL * MOD / i * inv[MOD % i] % MOD;\n    }\n    \n    vector<int> B(k + 1);\n    B[0] = 1;\n    for (int m = 1; m <= k; ++m) {\n        int sum = 0;\n        for (int j = 0; j < m; ++j) {\n            sum = (sum + 1LL * B[j] * inv[m + 1 - j]) % MOD;\n        }\n        B[m] = (MOD - sum) % MOD;\n    }\n    \n    int ans = 0;\n    int np = pow_mod(n + 1, k + 1);\n    for (int j = 0; j <= k; ++j) {\n        int term = 1LL * B[j] * pow_mod(n + 1, k + 1 - j) % MOD;\n        term = 1LL * term * inv[k + 1] % MOD;\n        if (j == 0) {\n            term = 1LL * term * (k + 1) % MOD;\n        } else {\n            term = 1LL * term * (k + 1 - j) % MOD;\n        }\n        ans = (ans + term) % MOD;\n    }\n    ans = (ans + MOD - 1LL * inv[k + 1] * (pow_mod(n + 1, k + 1) + MOD - 1) % MOD) % MOD;\n    ans = (MOD - ans) % MOD;\n    \n    cout << ans << '\\n';\n    \n    return 0;\n}\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Modular Inverses**: Precompute modular inverses to efficiently handle division under modulo.\n2. **Bernoulli Numbers**: Compute Bernoulli numbers using dynamic programming and modular arithmetic.\n3. **Faulhaber's Formula**: Use the formula to express the sum in terms of Bernoulli numbers and binomial coefficients, evaluated modulo \\(10^9 + 7\\).\n\nThis approach ensures that we efficiently compute the required sum using mathematical properties and dynamic programming, adhering to the problem constraints.",

Trees is a class of graphs which is interesting not only for people, but for ants too.\n\nAn ant stands at the root of some tree. He sees that there are n vertexes in the tree, and they are connected by n - 1 edges so that there is a path between any pair of vertexes. A leaf is a distinct from root vertex, which is connected with exactly one other vertex.\n\nThe ant wants to visit every vertex in the tree and return to the root, passing every edge twice. In addition, he wants to visit the leaves in a specific order. You are to find some possible route of the ant.\n\n## Constraints\nTime limit per test: 2.0 seconds\nMemory limit per test: 256.0 megabytes\n\n## Input Format\nThe first line contains integer n (3 ≤ n ≤ 300) — amount of vertexes in the tree. Next n - 1 lines describe edges. Each edge is described with two integers — indexes of vertexes which it connects. Each edge can be passed in any direction. Vertexes are numbered starting from 1. The root of the tree has number 1. The last line contains k integers, where k is amount of leaves in the tree. These numbers describe the order in which the leaves should be visited. It is guaranteed that each leaf appears in this order exactly once.\n\n## Output Format\nIf the required route doesn't exist, output -1. Otherwise, output 2n - 1 numbers, describing the route. Every time the ant comes to a vertex, output it's index.\n\n## Examples\n```input\n3\n1 2\n2 3\n3\n```\n```output\n1 2 3 2 1\n```\n-----\n```input\n6\n1 2\n1 3\n2 4\n4 5\n4 6\n5 6 3\n```\n```output\n1 2 4 5 4 6 4 2 1 3 1\n```\n-----\n```input\n6\n1 2\n1 3\n2 4\n4 5\n4 6\n5 3 6\n```\n```output\n-1\n```\n\n",

In the debates, he will be asked how to solve Byteland's transport problem. It's a really hard problem because of Byteland's transport system is now a tree (connected graph without cycles). Fedor's team has found out in the ministry of transport of Byteland that there is money in the budget only for one additional road. In the debates, he is going to say that he will build this road as a way to maximize the number of distinct simple paths in the country. A simple path is a path which goes through every vertex no more than once. Two simple paths are named distinct if sets of their edges are distinct.\n\nBut Byteland's science is deteriorated, so Fedor's team hasn't succeeded to find any scientists to answer how many distinct simple paths they can achieve after adding exactly one edge on the transport system?\n\nHelp Fedor to solve it.\n\nAn edge can be added between vertices that are already connected, but it can't be a loop.\n\nIn this problem, we consider only simple paths of length at least two.\n\n## Constraints\nTime limit per test: 2.0 seconds\nMemory limit per test: 256.0 megabytes\n\n## Input Format\nThe first line contains one integer $$$n$$$ ($$$2 \\leq n \\leq 500\\ 000$$$) — number of vertices in Byteland's transport system.\n\nEach of the following $$$n - 1$$$ lines contains two integers $$$v_i$$$ and $$$u_i$$$ ($$$1 \\leq v_i, u_i \\leq n$$$). It's guaranteed that the graph is tree.\n\n## Output Format\nPrint exactly one integer — a maximal number of simple paths that can be achieved after adding one edge.\n\n## Examples\n```input\n2\n1 2\n```\n```output\n2\n```\n-----\n```input\n4\n1 2\n1 3\n1 4\n```\n```output\n11\n```\n-----\n```input\n6\n1 2\n1 3\n3 4\n3 5\n4 6\n```\n```output\n29\n```\n\n## Editorial\nWe suppose we add an edge $$$u-v$$$. Path $$$u-v$$$ in the tree contains vertices $$$t_1, \\ldots, t_k$$$, where $$$k$$$ — length of the path, $$$t_1 = u, t_k = v$$$. For each vertex $$$x$$$ of the tree, we say that $$$f(x)$$$ — the closest to $$$x$$$ vertex of this path. Finally, we call a component of $$$t_i$$$ all vertices $$$x$$$ having $$$f(x) = t_i$$$.\nOne can notice that after adding an edge every pair of vertices may generate not more than two simple paths — the first one had already been in the tree, the second one may be generated using added edge. One can notice that every new path is generated by every pair of vertices lying in different components. Let's consider the sizes of components — $$$s_1, \\ldots, s_k$$$ respectively. So new path isn't generated for $$$\\sum\\limits_{i=1}^k \\frac{s_i \\cdot (s_i - 1)}{2}$$$ pairs of vertices. So we have the following problem — to minimize this sum.\nThus, we should minimize $$$\\sum\\limits_{i=1}^k \\frac{s_i \\cdot (s_i - 1)}{2}$$$, what is the same as, $$$\\sum\\limits_{i=1}^k s_i \\cdot (s_i - 1)$$$ = $$$\\sum\\limits_{i=1}^k s_i \\cdot s_i - s_i$$$ = $$$\\sum\\limits_{i=1}^k s_i^{2}$$$ (because of $$$\\sum\\limits_{i=1}^k s_i$$$ = $$$n$$$).\nIt's obvious now that $$$u, v$$$ are leafs of the tree (else we could decrease this sum increasing the path).\nFor convenience, we will hang the tree for a non-leaf. We will consider that $$$t_l = lca(u, v)$$$ in the path. Then, the desired sum will be:\n$$$A + B + C$$$, где\n$$$A = sz_{t_1}^{2} + (sz_{t_2} - sz_{t_1})^{2} + \\ldots + (sz_{t_l} - sz_{t_{l-1}})^{2}$$$\n$$$B = (n - sz_{t_{l-1}} - sz_{t_{l+1}})^{2}$$$\n$$$C = sz_{t_k}^{2} + (sz_{t_{k-1}} - sz_{t_k})^{2} + \\ldots + (sz_{t_l} - sz_{t_{l+1}})^{2}$$$\nWhen we fix $$$L = t_l$$$, $$$p_1 = t_{l+1}$$$ и $$$p_2 = t_{l-1}$$$, one can realize that $$$A$$$ doesn't depend on $$$L$$$ at all but depends on the subtree of $$$p_1$$$, as $$$C$$$ depends of the subtree of $$$p_2$$$. Thus these sums can easily be calculated using $$$DP$$$. Let $$$dp[x]$$$ be that optimal sum for vertex $$$x$$$. Then, when we fix $$$L$$$ — $$$lca(u, v)$$$ — we need to calculate the minimum by all different $$$p_1, p_2$$$ — children of $$$L$$$ — the following sum:\n$$$dp[p_1] + dp[p_2] + (n - sz_{p_1} - sz_{p_2})^{2}$$$.\nWe get:\n$$$n^{2} + dp[p1] - 2 \\cdot n \\cdot sz_{p_1} + dp[p2] - 2 \\cdot n \\cdot sz_{p_2} + 2 \\cdot sz_{p_1} \\cdot sz_{p_2}$$$.\nNow one can see that if we sort all vertices by $$$sz$$$ in non-increasing order one can use Convex Hull Trick — for the next vertex $$$p_2$$$ we find minimum by all $$$p_1$$$ which are already processed by functions $$$2 \\cdot sz_{p_1} \\cdot sz_{p_2} - 2 \\cdot n \\cdot sz_{p_1} + dp[p1]$$$, i.e $$$k = 2 \\cdot sz_{p_1}$$$, $$$b = - 2 \\cdot n \\cdot sz_{p_1} + dp[p1]$$$. $$$k$$$ decreases, thus we write usual CHT.\nComplexity is $$$O(n \\cdot log(n))$$$.\n",

One of the ways to improve readability is to give sensible names to the variables, so now Alice wants to rename some variables in her program. In her IDE there is a command called \"massive refactoring\", which can replace names of many variable in just one run. To use it, Alice needs to select two strings $$$s$$$ and $$$t$$$ and after that for each variable the following algorithm is performed: if the variable's name contains $$$s$$$ as a substring, then the first (and only first) occurrence of $$$s$$$ is replaced with $$$t$$$. If the name doesn't contain $$$s$$$, then this variable's name stays the same.\n\nThe list of variables is known and for each variable both the initial name and the name Alice wants this variable change to are known. Moreover, for each variable the lengths of the initial name and the target name are equal (otherwise the alignment of the code could become broken). You need to perform renaming of all variables in exactly one run of the massive refactoring command or determine that it is impossible.\n\n## Constraints\nTime limit per test: 1.0 seconds\nMemory limit per test: 256.0 megabytes\n\n## Input Format\nThe first line contains the only integer $$$n$$$ ($$$1 \\le n \\le 3000$$$) — the number of variables in Alice's program.\n\nThe following $$$n$$$ lines contain the initial names of variables $$$w_1, w_2, \\ldots, w_n$$$, one per line. After that, $$$n$$$ more lines go, the $$$i$$$-th of them contains the target name $$$w'_i$$$ for the $$$i$$$-th variable. It is guaranteed that $$$1 \\le |w_i| = |w'_i| \\le 3000$$$.\n\nIt is guaranteed that there is at least one variable having its target name different from the initial name. Both initial and target names consist of lowercase English letters only. For each variable the length of its initial name is equal to the length of its target name.\n\n## Output Format\nIf it is impossible to rename all variables with one call of \"massive refactoring\", print \"NO\" (quotes for clarity).\n\nOtherwise, on the first line print \"YES\" (quotes for clarity) and on the following lines print $$$s$$$ and $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \\le |s|, |t| \\le 5000$$$), which should be used for replacement. Strings $$$s$$$ and $$$t$$$ should consist only of lowercase letters of English alphabet.\n\nIf there are multiple ways to perform a \"massive refactoring\", you can use any of them.\n\n## Examples\n```input\n1\ntopforces\ncodecoder\n```\n```output\nYES\ntopforces\ncodecoder\n```\n-----\n```input\n3\nbab\ncac\ncdc\nbdb\ncdc\ncdc\n```\n```output\nYES\na\nd\n```\n-----\n```input\n2\nyou\nshal\nnot\npass\n```\n```output\nNO\n```\n\n## Editorial\nLet's take all variable names that have changed. First observation is that if you trim coinciding prefixes and suffixes from the original variable names and the resulting name, you will find the part that needs to be changed. We will call it \"the core\" of the replacement. All those parts need to be exactly the same. However we don't want to create string $$$s$$$ that matches things that we don't want to get changed, so we will try to expand the pattern to the left and to the right as much as possible. Each time we will check if adjacent symbols coincide, and, if so, expand the pattern.\nIn the end we will obtain longest possible $$$s$$$ and $$$t$$$ that may explain the differences. The final part is to check whether they actually work (this can be done with any kind of string search). Overall complexity is proportional to the size of the input.\n",
      "output": "To solve this problem, we need to determine if there exists a pair of strings \\( s \\) and \\( t \\) such that replacing the first occurrence of \\( s \\) with \\( t \\) in each variable's name transforms all original names into their target names in exactly one run of a refactoring command.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Identify Changed Variables**: First, identify all variables whose original names differ from their target names. If there are no such variables, it is impossible to perform the refactoring (though this case is guaranteed not to occur as per the problem constraints).\n\n2. **Determine Core Changes**: For each changed variable, determine the smallest substring (core) where the original and target names start and stop differing. This core will be the initial candidate for \\( s \\) (from the original name) and \\( t \\) (from the target name).\n\n3. **Validate Consistency**: Ensure all changed variables have the same core substrings for \\( s \\) and \\( t \\). If not, output \"NO\".\n\n4. **Expand Core**: Expand the core substrings \\( s \\) and \\( t \\) to the left and right as much as possible while ensuring consistency across all changed variables. This involves checking that expanding the core maintains the same characters in the original and target names across all variables.\n\n5. **Verify Solution**: Check if the expanded \\( s \\) and \\( t \\) work for all variables, including those that did not change. This ensures that applying \\( s \\) and \\( t \\) correctly transforms all variables.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nn = int(input())\noriginal = [input().strip() for _ in range(n)]\ntarget = [input().strip() for _ in range(n)]\n\nchanged = []\nfor i in range(n):\n    if original[i] != target[i]:\n        changed.append(i)\n\nif not changed:\n    print(\"YES\")\n    print(\"a\")\n    print(\"b\")\n    exit()\n\ns_list = []\nt_list = []\nleft_list = []\nright_list = []\n\nfor idx in changed:\n    ow = original[idx]\n    tw = target[idx]\n    left = 0\n    while left < len(ow) and ow[left] == tw[left]:\n        left += 1\n    right = len(ow) - 1\n    while right >= 0 and ow[right] == tw[right]:\n        right -= 1\n    s = ow[left:right+1]\n    t = tw[left:right+1]\n    s_list.append(s)\n    t_list.append(t)\n    left_list.append(left)\n    right_list.append(right)\n\ns_candidate = s_list[0]\nt_candidate = t_list[0]\nfor s, t in zip(s_list[1:], t_list[1:]):\n    if s != s_candidate or t != t_candidate:\n        print(\"NO\")\n        exit()\n\n# Expand left\ncan_expand = True\nwhile can_expand:\n    for i in range(len(changed)):\n        if left_list[i] == 0:\n            can_expand = False\n            break\n    if not can_expand:\n        break\n    ref_char_ow = original[changed[0]][left_list[0]-1]\n    ref_char_tw = target[changed[0]][left_list[0]-1]\n    all_ok = True\n    for i in range(1, len(changed)):\n        idx = changed[i]\n        current_left = left_list[i]\n        if original[idx][current_left-1] != ref_char_ow or target[idx][current_left-1] != ref_char_tw:\n            all_ok = False\n            break\n    if not all_ok:\n        break\n    for i in range(len(changed)):\n        left_list[i] -= 1\n\n# Expand right\ncan_expand = True\nwhile can_expand:\n    for i in range(len(changed)):\n        if right_list[i] == len(original[changed[i]]) - 1:\n            can_expand = False\n            break\n    if not can_expand:\n        break\n    ref_char_ow = original[changed[0]][right_list[0]+1]\n    ref_char_tw = target[changed[0]][right_list[0]+1]\n    all_ok = True\n    for i in range(1, len(changed)):\n        idx = changed[i]\n        current_right = right_list[i]\n        if original[idx][current_right+1] != ref_char_ow or target[idx][current_right+1] != ref_char_tw:\n            all_ok = False\n            break\n    if not all_ok:\n        break\n    for i in range(len(changed)):\n        right_list[i] += 1\n\nref_idx = changed[0]\ns = original[ref_idx][left_list[0]:right_list[0]+1]\nt = target[ref_idx][left_list[0]:right_list[0]+1]\n\nvalid = True\nfor i in range(n):\n    ow = original[i]\n    tw = target[i]\n    pos = ow.find(s)\n    if pos == -1:\n        if ow != tw:\n            valid = False\n            break\n    else:\n        new_str = ow[:pos] + t + ow[pos+len(s):]\n        if new_str != tw:\n            valid = False\n            break\n\nif valid:\n    print(\"YES\")\n    print(s)\n    print(t)\nelse:\n    print(\"NO\")\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The input is read and stored in lists for original and target variable names.\n2. **Identifying Changed Variables**: Variables whose original and target names differ are identified and stored.\n3. **Core Change Detection**: For each changed variable, the smallest substring (core) where the names start and stop differing is determined.\n4. **Consistency Check**: Ensure all changed variables have the same core substrings for \\( s \\) and \\( t \\).\n5. **Expanding Core**: Expand the core substrings to the left and right as much as possible while maintaining consistency.\n6. **Validation**: Check if the expanded \\( s \\) and \\( t \\) correctly transform all variables, including unchanged ones, to their target names.

Wires in palaces are made of expensive material, so selling some of them would be a good idea!\n\nEach grid (main and reserve) has a head node (its number is $$$1$$$). Every other node gets electricity from the head node. Each node can be reached from the head node by a unique path. Also, both grids have exactly $$$n$$$ nodes, which do not spread electricity further.\n\nIn other words, every grid is a rooted directed tree on $$$n$$$ leaves with a root in the node, which number is $$$1$$$. Each tree has independent enumeration and nodes from one grid are not connected with nodes of another grid.\n\nAlso, the palace has $$$n$$$ electrical devices. Each device is connected with one node of the main grid and with one node of the reserve grid. Devices connect only with nodes, from which electricity is not spread further (these nodes are the tree's leaves). Each grid's leaf is connected with exactly one device.\n\nIn this example the main grid contains $$$6$$$ nodes (the top tree) and the reserve grid contains $$$4$$$ nodes (the lower tree). There are $$$3$$$ devices with numbers colored in blue.\n\nIt is guaranteed that the whole grid (two grids and $$$n$$$ devices) can be shown in this way (like in the picture above):\n\n- main grid is a top tree, whose wires are directed 'from the top to the down',\n- reserve grid is a lower tree, whose wires are directed 'from the down to the top',\n- devices — horizontal row between two grids, which are numbered from $$$1$$$ to $$$n$$$ from the left to the right,\n- wires between nodes do not intersect.\n\nFormally, for each tree exists a depth-first search from the node with number $$$1$$$, that visits leaves in order of connection to devices $$$1, 2, \\dots, n$$$ (firstly, the node, that is connected to the device $$$1$$$, then the node, that is connected to the device $$$2$$$, etc.).\n\nBusinessman wants to sell (remove) maximal amount of wires so that each device will be powered from at least one grid (main or reserve).

      "output": "<think>\nOkay, I need to solve this problem. Let's read it carefully.\n\nThe problem is about two trees (main and reserve grids) each with n leaves connected to devices. The goal is to remove the maximum number of wires such that each device is still connected to at least one grid (through its tree). So, for each device, at least one of the main or reserve grid's path from the root to the device's node must be kept. The wires we can remove are those that are not needed in either of the trees after this condition is met.\n\nSo the task is to maximize the number of edges removed. That's equivalent to minimizing the number of edges kept in both trees. Because the total edges in both trees is fixed, subtracting the sum of edges kept in both gives the answer.\n\nBut how do we model which edges are kept? For each tree, certain edges must be kept if they are part of the path from the root to some device's node. But since each device can be covered by either main or reserve, the edges required are the union of edges needed for the main tree (for devices covered by main) and those needed for the reserve tree (for devices covered by reserve). The minimal total edges kept would be the sum of the edges in the main tree that are required for the devices chosen to be covered by main, plus the edges in the reserve tree required for the devices chosen to be covered by reserve. We need to choose which devices are covered by main and which by reserve such that the sum of the required edges in both trees is minimized. Then, subtract this sum from the total edges (a-1 + b-1) to get the maximum removable edges.\n\nSo the key is to model for each device, the set of edges in main and reserve that are on the path from the root to the device's node. Then, for each device, decide whether to cover it via main or reserve, such that the total edges used (the union of edges required for all chosen devices in main and reserve) is minimized. The answer is then (a-1 + b-1) - (sum of edges kept in main and reserve).\n\nSo how do we model the edges required for each device in each tree?\n\nFirst, for each tree (main and reserve), we need to find for each device the path from root to the node connected to the device. Each edge in this path must be kept if the device is covered by this tree.\n\nBut since multiple devices can share edges in their paths, the total edges kept in a tree is the union of all edges in the paths of the devices covered by that tree.\n\nSo the problem reduces to:\n\nSelect a subset S of devices (those covered by main) and the rest (n - S) covered by reserve. For each device in S, include all edges on the path from main's root to its node. For others, include all edges on reserve's path. The total edges kept is the size of the union of these edges in main and reserve. We need to choose S to minimize this sum. The answer is total edges in both trees minus this sum.\n\nSo the approach is:\n\n1. For each tree (main and reserve), precompute for each device the set of edges on the path from root to the device's node in that tree.\n\n2. Then, for all possible partitions of devices into those covered by main and reserve, compute the union size of the edges required in main for S and edges required in reserve for (n - S). The minimal such sum across all possible S will give the minimal edges kept, and the answer is (a-1 + b-1) - sum.\n\nBut n can be up to 1000. Trying all possible subsets S is impossible (2^1000 possibilities). So we need a smarter approach.\n\nAlternative idea: since the order of devices is determined by the DFS traversal (the leaves are ordered 1..n in both trees according to their in-order traversal), perhaps there's a way to model this as an interval covering problem.\n\nWait, the problem states that for each tree, the leaves are ordered 1..n according to a DFS traversal. So in each tree, the leaves are arranged in the order of the devices. So the leaves in the main tree are ordered 1 to n in the DFS order, same for reserve. But each device's main node and reserve node may be in different positions. But the devices are numbered 1..n, and each has a main leaf and a reserve leaf.\n\nBut how do the paths for the leaves in each tree look?\n\nIn a tree structured such that the leaves are in the order 1 to n via a DFS traversal, the paths to the leaves would form a structure where each subtree corresponds to an interval of device numbers. For example, the root's children might split the devices into contiguous ranges. So the edges along the path for device i in the main tree are those that cover the interval containing i.\n\nThis is similar to a segment tree or a hierarchical interval structure. For each node in the tree, the subtree corresponds to a contiguous interval of device indices. So each edge (from parent to child) in the tree can be associated with an interval of devices that pass through it.\n\nSo for each edge in the main tree, we can compute the interval [l, r] of device indices that use this edge. Similarly for the reserve tree. Then, for a set S of devices covered by main, the edges in main that need to be kept are those edges whose intervals intersect with S. For the reserve, the edges needed are those whose intervals intersect with the complement of S (devices not in S).\n\nBut how do we model this? The key is that the edges in each tree form intervals. So the problem reduces to selecting a subset S of [1..n], such that the sum of the number of edges in main whose intervals intersect S, plus the number of edges in reserve whose intervals intersect the complement of S, is minimized.\n\nBut how can we model this efficiently? This seems like a problem that can be solved using dynamic programming, considering the intervals and how they overlap.\n\nAlternatively, since the intervals in each tree form a hierarchical structure (as the tree is built such that each node's children cover contiguous intervals), maybe the intervals can be represented as ranges that are nested. For example, each edge's interval is a subset of its parent's interval. This would allow us to represent the edges in a way that for each tree, the edges form a structure where the intervals are hierarchical.\n\nLet me think: for each tree, the root's edge (if the root has children) would cover the entire interval [1, n]. Then each child would split into sub-intervals. For instance, if the root has two children, each child's subtree would cover a contiguous interval of devices. And so on, recursively. This structure is similar to a segment tree's structure, where each node represents an interval and splits into sub-intervals.\n\nIf that's the case, then the edges in each tree can be mapped to intervals [l, r] of devices. For each edge in the main tree, the interval represents the set of devices (indices) that pass through this edge. Similarly for the reserve tree.\n\nNow, the problem is to choose a subset S of devices such that:\n\nsum(edges in main that have any device in S in their interval) + sum(edges in reserve that have any device not in S in their interval) is minimized.\n\nThis is equivalent to:\n\nFor each edge in main, count 1 if its interval has a non-empty intersection with S. For each edge in reserve, count 1 if its interval has a non-empty intersection with the complement of S. Sum these counts and minimize.\n\nThe key is to model this for all possible S and find the minimal sum.\n\nBut with n up to 1000, and edges in each tree up to 1000 + n (so maybe up to 2000 edges per tree), how can we compute this?\n\nAn alternative approach is to model this as a graph where each device is a position, and the intervals for the edges determine which edges are activated based on the choice of S. However, this still seems challenging.\n\nWait, but the intervals for the edges in each tree are such that they form a collection of intervals where each edge's interval is a subset of its parent's interval. Because the tree is built such that the leaves are ordered by a DFS. So, the edges in the main tree and reserve tree can each be represented as a set of intervals, which form a hierarchical structure. Each edge's interval is a contiguous range, and the children's intervals are subranges of the parent's.\n\nThis structure is crucial. For example, in the main tree, the root's edge (assuming root is node 1) might split into children covering [1, k] and [k+1, n], and so on. So each edge's interval is a contiguous range, and the intervals are non-overlapping except for parent-child relationships.\n\nIf this is the case, then for each tree, the set of edges can be preprocessed to find their intervals. Once we have these intervals, the problem reduces to selecting a subset S such that for main edges, their interval has at least one element in S, and for reserve edges, their interval has at least one element in S's complement.\n\nBut how can we model this efficiently?\n\nLet's think of each edge in the main tree as requiring that S is not empty in its interval. If the edge's interval in the main tree has at least one device in S, then this edge must be kept. Similarly, for the reserve tree, the edge's interval must have at least one device not in S (i.e., in S's complement).\n\nThe minimal sum is the number of main edges activated plus the number of reserve edges activated, which we need to minimize.\n\nThis problem is similar to a bipartite graph where each edge in main and reserve can be represented as intervals, and S is a subset of devices that affects the activation of these edges. However, the challenge is finding the optimal S.\n\nAlternative idea: Since the intervals in each tree form a structure where they are hierarchical and contiguous, perhaps the intervals can be represented as a tree structure, and dynamic programming can be applied based on the intervals.\n\nAlternatively, for each position in the device list (1..n), decide whether to include it in S (covered by main) or not (covered by reserve), and track the impact on the edges in main and reserve.\n\nBut with n=1000, even O(n^2) solutions might be possible. Let's think about possible DP approaches.\n\nWait, here's another angle: For each device i, if we choose to cover it by main, then all edges in the main path of i are added to the main's required edges. If we don't, then all edges in the reserve path of i are added to the reserve's required edges. But edges are shared across multiple devices. For example, if device i and j share an edge in the main tree, then covering either i or j (or both) will add that edge once.\n\nSo, the problem is equivalent to selecting a subset S of devices such that the union of the edges in their main paths (for S) plus the union of the edges in the reserve paths (for ~S) is minimized.\n\nBut the problem is how to compute the size of these unions for a given S.\n\nTo model this, perhaps we can precompute for each edge in the main tree the set of devices that pass through it. Then, the main edges required are those edges where at least one device in S is in their set. Similarly for reserve edges and ~S.\n\nBut storing these sets for each edge is not feasible for n=1000 and edges up to 2000. However, given that the intervals are contiguous, maybe each edge's set is a contiguous range of devices. Then, for an edge in main tree, the set of devices that pass through it is an interval [l, r]. So the edge is required in main if and only if S intersects [l, r].\n\nSimilarly, in the reserve tree, an edge's interval [l, r] must intersect ~S (i.e., S doesn't cover the entire interval) for it to be required in reserve.\n\nSo the problem becomes: choose S (subset of devices) such that sum over main edges (1 if S ∩ [l_i, r_i] is non-empty) plus sum over reserve edges (1 if ~S ∩ [l'_j, r'_j] is non-empty) is minimized.\n\nNow, the intervals for main and reserve edges are known, and the key is to find S that minimizes the sum of main edges that have any overlap with S, plus reserve edges that have any overlap with the complement of S.\n\nHmm. How can we model this?\n\nLet's think of the problem as a binary decision for each device i: in S (cover by main) or not. Each decision affects the main and reserve edges.\n\nBut since the intervals are contiguous ranges, perhaps there's a way to model this using dynamic programming where the state represents the current coverage in the main and reserve intervals.\n\nAlternatively, we can model the intervals in the main and reserve trees and find a way to select S such that for the main edges, S must cover at least one point in each of their intervals, and for reserve edges, the complement of S must cover at least one point in their intervals.\n\nBut this seems tricky. Let's think of each main edge as a condition that S must include at least one element in its interval. Similarly, each reserve edge's condition is that S must exclude at least one element in its interval. Wait no: reserve edges are required if their interval has at least one element in ~S, which is equivalent to the interval not being entirely contained in S.\n\nSo, for each reserve edge's interval [l, r], the edge is required if there exists a device i in [l, r] that is not in S. So, the edge is required if S does not contain all of [l, r]. So the reserve edge is required unless S includes all devices in [l, r].\n\nSo the problem is to choose S to minimize:\n\nsum_{e in main} (1 if S ∩ [l_e, r_e] is non-empty) + sum_{e in reserve} (1 if [l'_e, r'_e] \\ S is non-empty).\n\nThis is a complex optimization problem.\n\nBut considering that the intervals are contiguous and ordered, perhaps there's a way to model this with a dynamic programming approach that tracks the positions and the required conditions.\n\nLet me think about how the intervals are structured. For each tree, the edges form a hierarchy where each edge's interval is a subset of its parent's. So, for the main tree, the root's edge (if present) covers all devices. Then, each child's edge covers a sub-interval. This forms a structure where the edges can be represented as nodes in a tree, with intervals that are contained within their parent's intervals.\n\nBut how does this help? Perhaps for the main tree, the edges that must be kept are those that are ancestors of at least one device in S. Similarly for the reserve tree.\n\nAlternatively, each edge in the main tree is part of the path for a certain interval of devices. So, for the main tree, the set of edges required is the union of the paths of all devices in S. Similarly for the reserve tree, the edges required are the union of the paths of all devices not in S.\n\nBut again, how to compute this efficiently.\n\nAnother approach: For each tree, the minimal set of edges required when covering a subset of devices is the union of all edges in their paths. The size of this union can be computed as the sum of the edges in the tree's paths, but considering that some edges are shared among multiple devices.\n\nBut how can we model the minimal sum when selecting which devices to cover in each tree.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem can be transformed into selecting a subset S of devices to cover via main, such that the sum of the edges in main's required set (for S) plus the edges in reserve's required set (for ~S) is minimized.\n\nSo the problem can be thought of as a bipartition of the devices into two sets, and for each set, compute the number of edges required in their respective trees.\n\nThe key is to find a bipartition that minimizes the sum of the two edge counts.\n\nSo, how to compute for each possible S, the required edges in main and reserve.\n\nBut with n=1000, even O(n^2) is 1e6, which is manageable, but O(2^n) is impossible.\n\nAlternative idea: Precompute for each device i, the set of edges in the main tree (path from root to x_i) and in the reserve tree (path from root to y_i). Then, the required edges for main is the union of the edges of all devices in S. For reserve, it's the union of edges of all devices not in S.\n\nThe sum to minimize is the size of the union for main plus the size of the union for reserve.\n\nSo the problem reduces to finding a subset S such that (|U_main(S)| + |U_reserve(~S)|) is minimized.\n\nBut how to compute this efficiently.\n\nBut even here, for n=1000, enumerating all possible subsets is impossible. So we need a smarter way.\n\nBut perhaps there's a way to model this as a graph problem where each device can be in S or not, and edges are added based on their impact on the unions.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the minimal sum can be found by considering that each device contributes some cost when included in S (adding new edges to main's union) and some cost when not included (adding new edges to reserve's union). But since edges are shared among devices, this isn't straightforward.\n\nAnother angle: For each edge in the main tree, it's included in the main's required edges if at least one device in S is in its interval. Similarly, for each edge in the reserve tree, it's included if at least one device not in S is in its interval.\n\nThus, the total cost for a subset S is:\n\nsum_{e in main} [S ∩ interval(e) is not empty] + sum_{e in reserve} [(complement of S) ∩ interval(e) is not empty}.\n\nThe problem is to choose S to minimize this sum.\n\nThis seems like a problem that can be modeled with inclusion-exclusion, but I'm not seeing the way.\n\nWait, perhaps for each edge in the main tree, the cost is 1 if S includes any of the devices in its interval. For reserve edges, the cost is 1 if the complement of S includes any of the devices in its interval.\n\nSo for each edge, we can model whether it's included based on S. The sum is the sum of all these 1s.\n\nThe challenge is to find S that minimizes this sum.\n\nAlternative idea: model this as a bipartite graph where each edge is a node, and edges are connected to the devices in their intervals. Then, the problem is to select a subset of devices (S) such that for each main edge, at least one device in its interval is selected, and for each reserve edge, at least one device in its interval is not selected. But this is not a bipartite graph, and the constraints are complex.\n\nAnother thought: Since each edge in main and reserve has an interval, and we need to cover certain intervals in main and reserve, perhaps the optimal S is such that it covers all the intervals of the main edges that are required, and avoids covering all the intervals of the reserve edges that are required. But I'm not sure.\n\nWait, for each main edge e, if we choose any device in e's interval to be in S, then e is counted. So, to minimize the main sum, we want as few edges as possible to have S include any of their intervals. But that's conflicting with the reserve sum. So this is a trade-off.\n\nBut how do we model this?\n\nAlternatively, for each device i, if we choose to include it in S, we are adding all the edges in its main path (but not adding any in reserve's path). However, if we choose to not include it in S, we are adding all edges in its reserve path.\n\nBut since edges can be shared, the total cost is the union of all edges from S's main paths and the union of edges from ~S's reserve paths.\n\nThe problem is to find the minimal size of this union.\n\nBut how can we model this?\n\nThis feels like a problem that can be modeled with a bipartition and for each device, track the edges added when it's in S or not. But for n=1000, even that seems challenging.\n\nAlternative approach: Let's precompute for each device the set of edges in its main path and reserve path. Then, for a subset S, the main edges required are the union of the main paths of all devices in S. The reserve edges required are the union of the reserve paths of all devices not in S. The sum is the size of these two unions.\n\nSo the minimal sum is the minimal possible size of the union of the main edges of S and the reserve edges of ~S.\n\nBut how can we compute this efficiently.\n\nAnother idea: the union of the main edges for S is the same as the edges that are on the path of at least one device in S. Similarly for the reserve edges of ~S.\n\nBut this seems computationally intensive unless there's a way to model the edges' inclusion efficiently.\n\nLet's think of each edge in the main tree as being required if any device in S is in its interval. So for the main tree, the edges required are those whose interval overlaps with S. For the reserve tree, the edges required are those whose interval overlaps with ~S.\n\nThe intervals for the edges are contiguous ranges, and the main and reserve trees are structured such that the intervals are hierarchical.\n\nSo, perhaps the optimal S is a contiguous interval. But I'm not sure. For example, if the main edges are such that some intervals are non-overlapping, splitting the devices into parts where S covers some intervals and not others may be optimal. But this is not clear.\n\nAlternatively, since the intervals are ordered (device numbers are 1..n), perhaps the optimal S can be represented as a set of intervals where each interval is a contiguous block of devices. This might allow a dynamic programming approach where we track the start and end positions and the required edges.\n\nFor example, we can model the problem as choosing a set of intervals (contiguous) in S, and compute the cost for each such choice. But with n=1000, even this approach might not be feasible.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the optimal S is a prefix or suffix of the device order. But this depends on the structure of the intervals. For example, if the main edges' intervals are all towards the beginning, then covering a prefix may be optimal. But this is not necessarily the case.\n\nAlternatively, the problem can be viewed as a two-coloring problem, where each device is colored as either main (in S) or reserve (not in S). The cost is the sum of main edges that have at least one main-colored device in their interval plus reserve edges that have at least one reserve-colored device in their interval.\n\nBut again, how to model this.\n\nLet me think of the problem for each device. Choosing to color it main adds all edges in its main path to the main's required edges (if not already added). Choosing reserve adds all edges in its reserve path to the reserve's required edges (if not already added).\n\nBut this is a problem of choosing colors for the devices such that the sum of the new edges added is minimized.\n\nThis seems like a problem that can be modeled with dynamic programming, where the state represents the current edges in main and reserve. But this is impossible due to the huge state space.\n\nAlternative idea: Since the intervals for the edges are contiguous and ordered, perhaps for each position i in the device list, we can track which intervals are covered in the main and reserve trees.\n\nFor example, for the main tree, if the current position is i, and we decide to include i in S, then all main edges whose intervals include i are marked as covered. Similarly for not including i in S and covering reserve edges.\n\nBut this is not straightforward.\n\nAnother approach: Let's precompute for each edge in the main tree the minimal and maximal device index in its interval. Similarly for the reserve tree. Then, for each edge in the main tree, it's required if S includes at least one device in [l, r]. For each edge in the reserve tree, it's required if the complement of S includes at least one device in [l', r'].\n\nNow, the sum is the count of main edges where S overlaps their interval plus the count of reserve edges where S does not cover their entire interval.\n\nWait, no. For reserve edges, the edge is required if there's at least one device in [l', r'] not in S. So, the edge is required if S does not include all of [l', r'].\n\nSo, for a reserve edge with interval [l, r], it's required if S is not a superset of [l, r]. So, if even one device in [l, r] is not in S, then the edge is required.\n\nSo for reserve edges, the edge is required if S does not contain the entire interval.\n\nThis is a key observation. So for the reserve edges, their intervals must not be fully contained in S for the edge to be required.\n\nSo, the sum is:\n\nsum_{e in main} (S intersects e.interval) + sum_{e in reserve} (e.interval is not a subset of S).\n\nNow, the problem is to choose S such that this sum is minimized.\n\nThis is a different way to look at the problem. So for the main tree, each edge is counted if S contains any device in its interval. For the reserve tree, each edge is counted unless all devices in its interval are in S.\n\nSo, the goal is to find S that covers as many reserve intervals as possible (so that their edges are not counted) and covers as few main intervals as possible (so their edges are not counted).\n\nBut how to model this.\n\nLet's consider that for each reserve edge e, if S includes all of e.interval, then e is not counted. So, the reserve edge e contributes 0 to the sum if e.interval is a subset of S, else 1.\n\nThus, the total sum is:\n\nsum_main (S intersects e.interval) + sum_reserve (e.interval not subset of S).\n\nThis seems like a problem where we can model the choice of S as trying to cover all intervals of the reserve edges (to avoid their contribution) while covering as few main intervals as possible.\n\nBut this is a conflict because covering a device to include it in S may cover some reserve intervals but also activate some main intervals.\n\nSo, this is a trade-off between covering reserve intervals (to avoid their edges) and not covering main intervals (to avoid their edges).\n\nAn alternative way to think is that each reserve interval e has a cost of 1 if not fully covered by S, and 0 otherwise. Each main interval e has a cost of 1 if S intersects e, and 0 otherwise. We need to choose S to minimize the total cost.\n\nNow, how can we model this?\n\nLet's consider all possible intervals for the reserve edges. For each reserve edge e, the best case is that S includes all of e.interval, which reduces the total cost by 1. However, including those devices in S may cause some main edges to be activated (if their intervals are intersected by S).\n\nSo, it's a matter of choosing which reserve edges to cover (by including their entire interval in S), which saves the cost of 1 for each such edge, but may add cost from main edges that are activated by the inclusion of their intervals.\n\nSo, for each reserve edge, we can decide whether to cover it (include its entire interval in S) to save 1 cost, but this may require adding some main edges' costs.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps this can be modeled as a graph where each node represents a decision point, and edges represent the cost of including or excluding certain intervals.\n\nBut this is vague. Let's think of it as a binary decision for each device: include in S or not. However, with n=1000, we need a way to compute this efficiently.\n\nAlternative idea: Since the intervals in the reserve tree are structured in a hierarchy, perhaps the optimal S is a collection of intervals in the device list that are chosen to cover as many reserve edges as possible (i.e., their entire intervals are included in S) while avoiding overlapping with as many main edges as possible.\n\nBut this is a heuristic and not a guaranteed solution.\n\nAnother approach is to model this as a bipartite graph and find a minimum cut. Let's see.\n\nSuppose we model the problem as a flow network where:\n\n- Each device is a node, and there are two additional nodes: source (S) and sink (T).\n\n- For each device i, there is an edge from S to i with a certain capacity, representing the cost of including i in S (which affects main edges) and not including i (which affects reserve edges).\n\nBut I'm not sure how to model the main and reserve edges' costs in this way.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps for each main edge e, there is a penalty if any device in e's interval is chosen. For each reserve edge e, there is a penalty if not all devices in e's interval are chosen.\n\nThis sounds like a problem that can be transformed into a vertex cover problem with certain constraints, but I'm not certain.\n\nAlternatively, think of the problem as follows:\n\nFor each main edge e, create a variable X_e which is 1 if S intersects e's interval, else 0.\n\nFor each reserve edge e, create a variable Y_e which is 1 if e's interval is not a subset of S, else 0.\n\nThe sum is sum X_e + sum Y_e, which we need to minimize.\n\nThe variables X_e and Y_e are linked through the choice of S.\n\nBut how to model the relationships between S and the variables.\n\nAnother idea: For each device i, let x_i be a binary variable indicating whether i is in S (x_i=1) or not (x_i=0).\n\nFor a main edge e with interval [l, r], X_e = 1 iff sum_{i=l}^r x_i >= 1.\n\nFor a reserve edge e with interval [l, r], Y_e = 1 iff sum_{i=l}^r (1 - x_i) >= 1.\n\nThe total cost is sum X_e + sum Y_e.\n\nWe need to find the x_i's that minimize this.\n\nThis is an integer linear programming problem, but with n=1000, it's not feasible to solve directly.\n\nBut perhaps there's a way to model this using the structure of the intervals. For example, since the main and reserve edges are hierarchical, their intervals are nested.\n\nSo for each main edge e, the interval is [l_e, r_e], and this is a subset of the intervals of its ancestors. So, if we can find the minimal set of intervals in the main tree that need to be covered (i.e., have at least one x_i=1 in their interval) to cover all required main edges, but the problem is to choose S such that this is done with minimal overlap.\n\nBut I'm not sure.\n\nAnother observation: The minimal sum can be computed by subtracting the maximal possible number of edges that can be saved. The total possible edges is (main_edges + reserve_edges). For each main edge, we can save it (not include in the sum) by ensuring that no device in its interval is in S. For each reserve edge, we can save it by ensuring that all devices in its interval are in S. So the maximal savings is the number of main edges where S does not intersect their interval plus the number of reserve edges where S contains their entire interval.\n\nBut this is equivalent to the problem of choosing S to maximize the sum of:\n\n(number of main edges with S ∩ e.interval = empty) + (number of reserve edges with e.interval subset S).\n\nThe total sum of edges to keep is main_edges + reserve_edges - (saved_main + saved_reserve).\n\nSo, the problem reduces to maximizing saved_main + saved_reserve.\n\nThis seems like the same problem as before, but phrased differently.\n\nBut how to model this.\n\nFor each main edge e, saved_main increases by 1 if S doesn't intersect e.interval.\n\nFor each reserve edge e, saved_reserve increases by 1 if e.interval is a subset of S.\n\nThe goal is to choose S to maximize this sum.\n\nNow, this seems like a problem where we can model each main and reserve edge's conditions and find the best S.\n\nBut again, with n=1000 and many edges, this is challenging.\n\nBut perhaps there's a way to model this with dynamic programming, especially given the hierarchical structure of the intervals.\n\nLet's consider the structure of the main and reserve trees. Each tree is built in a way that the leaves are ordered 1..n according to a DFS. So, each tree's structure is such that the intervals of the edges are contiguous and nested. For example, the root's interval is [1, n]. Its children's intervals are [1, k] and [k+1, n], and so on.\n\nThis structure implies that the edges form a binary tree (or more generally, a tree) where each node's interval is a contiguous subset of its parent's interval. So, the edges can be represented in a way that their intervals are nested and contiguous.\n\nThis structure suggests that for each tree, the intervals can be processed in a hierarchical manner, and decisions about covering the intervals can be made recursively.\n\nFor example, for the main tree, the root's edge interval is [1, n]. To save this edge (i.e., not include any device from S in its interval), we must choose S to have no devices in [1, n], which is impossible (since S is a subset of [1, n]). So the root's main edge can't be saved. But wait, the main edge is part of the path for all devices, so the root's edge is required if any device is in S. So the root's main edge is saved only if no device is in S. But then, all devices are covered by reserve, which would require all reserve edges to be required. This is not possible unless all reserve edges are required. So this seems like a bad choice.\n\nBut perhaps for the main tree, the root's edge is always required if S is not empty. So if S is non-empty, the root's main edge is required. So the main edge can't be saved unless S is empty. But then, all reserve edges would be required, which is bad.\n\nBut this is just an example. The point is, the hierarchical structure of the intervals can allow us to model the problem using dynamic programming, where for each node in the tree, we decide whether to save its edge by ensuring certain conditions on the subset S.\n\nBut how?\n\nLet's think recursively. For each edge in the main tree, to save it (i.e., not include it in the sum), we must ensure that no device in its interval is chosen in S. For the edge's interval [l, r], this means S must not include any of the devices in [l, r]. \n\nBut if the edge's parent has a larger interval, then saving the parent's edge would require not choosing any device in its interval. So, saving a child edge requires that the parent's edge is not saved (since if the parent's edge is saved, the child's edge is automatically saved).\n\nThis suggests that the decision to save an edge in the main tree is only possible if none of its ancestors' edges are saved. This is because the ancestor's intervals include the child's interval.\n\nSimilarly, for the reserve tree, saving an edge (i.e., ensuring that all devices in its interval are in S) requires that all ancestors' edges are saved (since their intervals include the current edge's interval).\n\nThis seems to complicate things.\n\nBut perhaps we can model the problem with dynamic programming where for each node in the main tree and reserve tree, we track certain conditions.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the optimal S is the union of some intervals in the reserve tree's edges. Because for each reserve edge, if S includes its entire interval, then that edge is saved (not required). So, including as many such intervals as possible in S would save more reserve edges. However, including these intervals may require including devices in main intervals, which could activate main edges.\n\nSo, the optimal solution is to find a set of reserve edges whose intervals are all covered by S (i.e., S includes all devices in their intervals) such that the sum of the saved reserve edges and the saved main edges (those whose intervals have no devices in S) is maximized.\n\nBut how to find this set.\n\nAn alternative approach is to greedily select reserve edges to save, starting from the largest possible intervals. Because saving a larger interval would cover more devices and potentially save more reserve edges. But this may not be optimal due to main edges.\n\nBut again, this is not guaranteed to be optimal.\n\nAlternatively, we can model this as a bipartite graph between the reserve edges and main edges. Each reserve edge has a set of devices (its interval) that need to be included in S. Including them may activate certain main edges. We need to select a set of reserve edges to save such that the saved reserve edges minus the cost of the main edges activated is maximized.\n\nBut this is a possible approach. For each reserve edge e, saving it gives a profit of 1 (since we avoid its cost) but requires including all devices in e's interval. This inclusion will activate all main edges whose intervals intersect e's interval. So the cost is the number of main edges whose intervals intersect e's interval. The profit is 1 (for saving e) minus the number of main edges activated by including e's interval.\n\nThe problem then becomes selecting a subset of reserve edges that can be saved (their intervals are pairwise compatible, i.e., their intervals are nested or disjoint), and summing their profits, subtracting the cost of activating main edges.\n\nBut this is still a complex problem.\n\nAnother observation: The main edges and reserve edges are structured as trees. So, for each tree, the edges form a hierarchy. For the main tree, the intervals are nested, and for the reserve tree, the intervals are nested.\n\nIn the main tree, each edge's interval is a sub-interval of its parent's. So, for example, the root's interval is [1, n]. Its children have intervals [1, k] and [k+1, n], etc.\n\nIn the reserve tree, each edge's interval is also a sub-interval of its parent's.\n\nSo, the edges in each tree can be represented as a tree structure where each node represents an edge with a contiguous interval.\n\nGiven this, perhaps we can model the problem by considering the two trees and making decisions based on their hierarchical intervals.\n\nFor example, in the reserve tree, to save an edge e, we must include all devices in e's interval in S. However, doing so may activate main edges whose intervals intersect with e's interval. The activation of main edges depends on whether any device in their intervals is in S.\n\nBut since S is required to include all devices in e's interval (to save e), the main edges whose intervals overlap with e's interval will have their intervals intersected by S. Thus, those main edges will be activated (counted in the sum).\n\nSo, saving a reserve edge e has a net gain of 1 (for saving e) minus the number of main edges whose intervals overlap with e's interval. This net gain could be positive or negative.\n\nThe problem is to select a set of reserve edges (with nested intervals) such that their intervals are mutually compatible (i.e., their intervals can all be covered by S), and the total gain is maximized.\n\nBut how to find this set.\n\nThe intervals in the reserve tree are arranged in a hierarchy. So, selecting a child edge requires that its parent's edge is also selected. Because if a child's interval is covered by S, then the parent's interval is a superset, so the parent's interval must also be covered (since the child's interval is a subset of the parent's). But in this case, saving the child's edge requires that the entire child's interval is in S. The parent's edge's interval is a superset, but saving the parent's edge requires the entire parent's interval is in S. So, saving the child's edge doesn't require saving the parent's edge. However, if the parent's interval is not covered by S, then saving the child's edge is still possible as long as the child's interval is fully covered. But this is possible only if the child's interval is a subset of S, but the parent's interval may have parts outside S.\n\nWait, no. For example, if the parent's interval is [1, 10], and the child's is [3, 7], and S includes [3, 7], then the parent's interval is not covered (since 1-2 and 8-10 are not in S). So, saving the child's edge (which requires S includes [3,7]) is possible even if the parent's edge is not saved.\n\nBut the parent's edge's interval is [1,10], so the parent's edge is required if there's any device in [1,10] not in S. Since S includes [3,7], there are devices in [1,2] and [8,10] not in S, so the parent's edge is required. But the child's edge is saved because S includes all of its interval.\n\nSo, in this case, the child's edge is saved (counts as 0 in the sum), but the parent's edge is still required (counts as 1).\n\nSo, the reserve edge's intervals can be saved independently of their parent's edges. But if a parent's edge is saved, then all of its children's edges are automatically saved if their intervals are subsets of the parent's.\n\nSo, the optimal way to save reserve edges is to select a set of edges in the reserve tree such that their intervals are not overlapping (except for nested intervals) and the sum of (1 - the number of main edges that overlap their intervals) is maximized.\n\nBut how to model this.\n\nThis feels like a dynamic programming problem on the reserve tree's structure. For each node in the reserve tree, we can decide whether to save it (i.e., include all devices in its interval in S) or not. If we save it, we gain 1 but lose the number of main edges that overlap with its interval. If we don't save it, we can recursively consider its children.\n\nSo, for each node in the reserve tree:\n\n- Option 1: Save this node. Then, all devices in its interval are included in S. We add 1 (saved reserve edge) minus the number of main edges overlapping with this interval. But by including all devices in the interval, any main edge whose interval overlaps with this reserve interval will be activated (counted). So, the number of main edges overlapping with this interval is the number of main edges e where e.interval intersects this reserve interval.\n\n- Option 2: Do not save this node. Then, we can recursively consider its children. But we lose the opportunity to save this node's edge, so we gain 0 and can save child edges.\n\nWe need to choose the option (save or not) that maximizes the total gain.\n\nThis approach could work if we can precompute for each reserve edge the number of main edges that overlap with its interval. Then, the decision is to save the reserve edge (adding 1 - cost) or not, and proceed recursively.\n\nThis is a dynamic programming approach on the reserve tree's structure, where for each node, we compute the maximum gain possible.\n\nBut first, we need to compute for each reserve edge the number of main edges that overlap with its interval. Then, when we save a reserve edge, we pay a cost of the number of overlapping main edges.\n\nThis way, the total gain for saving a reserve edge e is (1 - number of overlapping main edges).\n\nSo, the dynamic programming state for a reserve tree node is the maximum gain attainable from that subtree.\n\nThe recurrence would be:\n\ndp[reserve_node] = max(\n   (1 - cost) + sum of dp[child] where child is not in the subtree of reserve_node (since saving this node's interval would cover all children's intervals),\n   sum of dp[children] (if we don't save this node)\n)\n\nWait, no. If we save this node, we include all devices in its interval. Therefore, all children's intervals are subsets of this interval, and saving this node's interval would automatically save all children's edges (since their intervals are subsets). But according to the problem statement, each reserve edge's interval is a subset of its parent's. So, if we include the entire parent's interval in S, then all children's intervals are also included. So, saving the parent's edge automatically saves all children's edges, as their entire intervals are included in S.\n\nBut this isn't the case. Saving the parent's edge requires that the entire parent's interval is in S. This means that any child edge's interval is a subset of the parent's interval, so if the parent's edge is saved, the child's edge's interval is also in S, so the child's edge is automatically saved. However, the cost of saving the parent's edge is 1 (gain) minus the number of overlapping main edges. So, if we save the parent's edge, we can ignore the children's edges (since they are already saved).\n\nTherefore, the recurrence for the dynamic programming is:\n\nFor a given reserve node (edge) e:\n\n- If we save e, we gain 1 (for saving e) minus the number of main edges overlapping with e's interval. But we cannot save any of e's children (since their intervals are subsets of e's interval, and saving e implies that they are already saved).\n\n- If we do not save e, we can choose to save some of e's children, and the gain is the sum of the maximum gains of the children.\n\nSo, the DP recurrence is:\n\ndp[e] = max( (1 - cost_e) + sum of dp[not taken children], sum of dp[children] )\n\nBut I think that when we save e, we take the gain for e and do not consider any children (since they are already saved). When we do not save e, we can choose to save any subset of children (each child can be saved or not, but their intervals may be independent).\n\nWait, no. The children of e in the reserve tree are edges with intervals that are subsets of e's interval. If we do not save e, then each child can be saved or not, but their intervals are subsets of e's interval. So, even if e is not saved, the children's intervals can be saved independently, as long as their intervals are covered by S.\n\nBut this complicates the DP, as the children's intervals are nested. For example, if we save a child, that requires its interval to be a subset of S, but the parent's interval (e) is not necessarily saved. So, saving a child's edge requires that S covers its interval. This does not depend on the parent's decision.\n\nSo, the DP should consider each node's decision independently, but since the intervals are nested, saving a child's edge can overlap with saving a parent's edge.\n\nThis seems complicated, but perhaps the hierarchical structure allows a bottom-up DP approach.\n\nLet me think of the reserve tree's edges in a bottom-up manner (processing leaves first). For each reserve edge e:\n\nThe maximum gain for e's subtree is the maximum between:\n\n1. Saving e: gain is (1 - cost_e) + sum of gains from all ancestor edges that are not saved. But this is not correct. \n\nWait, no. If we save e, then all devices in e's interval are in S. So, all edges in the reserve tree that have intervals contained within e's interval can be saved if their intervals are covered. But since e's interval is a superset, and we are saving e (entire interval is in S), saving e's children's edges would not require any additional devices. But since saving e's edge includes all of its children's intervals, those children's edges are automatically saved. So, saving e's edge implies that all of its descendants' edges are also saved. But this would have a cost of 1 for e's edge, and the cost of any main edges overlapping e's interval.\n\nBut this would also mean that if we save e's edge, we cannot save any of its descendants' edges, because their intervals are already covered. However, the descendants' edges would be automatically saved if e's edge is saved. But the problem is that each edge in the reserve tree is considered individually. Saving e's edge gives a gain of 1 (for e's edge) and automatically gives the gains for all descendant edges (since they are saved). But this is not the case. Because if e's edge is saved (i.e., all devices in its interval are in S), then any descendant edge's interval is a subset of e's interval, so all of their devices are in S. Thus, those descendant edges are also saved, contributing their gain. So, saving e's edge would give gain for e's edge and all descendants. But that's not correct. Because the gain for e's edge is 1, and the gain for the descendants' edges is 1 each. But if e is saved, then all descendants' edges are automatically saved. So, the total gain for saving e is 1 (e's gain) + sum of gains of all descendants' edges (which are also saved). But this would be incorrect, because the descendants' edges are saved because their intervals are subsets of e's interval, which is saved. So, in the dynamic programming approach, if we choose to save e's edge, we must include the gains for all of its descendants' edges.\n\nBut this is not correct, because the descendants' edges can also be saved on their own. For example, if we do not save e's edge, but save a child's edge, the child's edge is saved if its interval is covered by S. But the child's interval is a subset of e's interval. So, saving the child's edge requires covering its interval, but not the entire e's interval.\n\nThis suggests that the DP for the reserve tree must consider whether the current node's edge is saved or not, and when it is saved, all descendants' edges are automatically saved. When it is not saved, the descendants' edges can be saved or not.\n\nBut how to model this.\n\nLet me think recursively. For a given reserve edge e:\n\n- If we save e, then all devices in e's interval are in S. This means that all of e's descendants' edges are automatically saved (since their intervals are subsets of e's). So, the total gain for saving e is (1 - cost_e) + sum of (1 - cost_d) for all descendants d of e. But this is not correct, because the descendants' edges are saved, but the cost of overlapping main edges for each of them must be considered. However, when we save e, we include all devices in e's interval, which may overlap with main edges. The cost_e is the number of main edges overlapping e's interval. So, the total cost when saving e is cost_e. But the descendants' edges would also have their cost_d, but their intervals are subsets of e's. So, overlapping main edges with the descendants' intervals are already counted in cost_e. So, saving e's edge would activate all main edges overlapping e's interval, which includes all main edges overlapping any of the descendants' intervals.\n\nTherefore, the cost for e's edge is the number of main edges overlapping e's interval, which includes all main edges overlapping any of e's descendants' intervals. So, when we save e, we pay the cost_e, and gain 1 (for saving e) and also gain 1 for each of e's descendants' edges (since they are saved). But the cost of their edges is already included in cost_e.\n\nWait, no. The cost of a main edge is 1 if it overlaps with any device in S. So, if a main edge's interval overlaps with e's interval, then it is counted once, regardless of how many of its descendants' intervals overlap with it.\n\nSo, the cost for e is the number of main edges whose intervals overlap with e's interval. But saving e's edge (including all devices in e's interval) would activate those main edges. However, any main edge overlapping a descendant's interval would also overlap e's interval (since the descendant's interval is a subset), so those main edges are already counted in cost_e. Therefore, when we save e, the cost is cost_e, and we get a gain of (1 - cost_e) plus the sum of the gains from saving all descendants' edges, which is (sum (1 - cost_d)), but since their cost_d is already part of cost_e, this would be double-counting.\n\nThis suggests that the initial approach is incorrect. So perhaps the correct approach is to precompute for each reserve edge e the number of main edges overlapping e's interval. Then, when we save e's edge, the gain is (1 - cost_e), where cost_e is the number of main edges overlapping e's interval. This is because saving e's edge gives a gain of 1 (saved reserve edge) but costs cost_e (main edges activated). The net gain is 1 - cost_e.\n\nBut when we save e's edge, all of its descendants' edges are automatically saved, but their gains are already included in the net gain for e. Because, the main edges overlapping the descendants' intervals are already counted in cost_e. So, the descendants' edges are saved (gain 1 each) but their cost is already accounted for in e's cost.\n\nSo, the total gain for saving e's edge is 1 (for e) + sum of gains for all descendants' edges (each 1) - cost_e (number of main edges overlapping e's interval). But this is equivalent to (sum of 1 for e and all descendants) - cost_e. However, the descendants' edges are saved automatically, but their cost (which is the main edges overlapping their intervals) is included in e's cost_e. So, the total gain for saving e's edge is (number of reserve edges in e's subtree) - cost_e.\n\nAlternatively, this is not the case. Because the main edges overlapping e's interval are counted once in cost_e, but if a descendant's edge is saved, its own cost would include the same main edges again. But this is not the case when saving e's edge, since the descendant's edges are saved automatically.\n\nThis is getting very complicated. Perhaps I need to model this as follows:\n\nFor each reserve edge e, if we save e (include its entire interval in S), then:\n\n- The gain is 1 (saved reserve edge e) plus the sum of gains from saving all of e's descendants (since their intervals are subsets of e's, and thus included in S).\n\n- The cost is the number of main edges whose intervals overlap with e's interval.\n\nBut this is not correct. Because the main edges overlapping e's interval are counted once, but saving e's descendants would have their own cost, which may include the same main edges. But when we save e's edge, the descendants' edges are automatically saved (their intervals are subsets of e's, so included in S). But the cost for saving e's edge is the number of main edges overlapping e's interval, which includes all main edges overlapping the descendants' intervals.\n\nTherefore, when we save e's edge, we pay the cost of all main edges overlapping e's interval. This includes the main edges overlapping any of the descendants' intervals. Thus, the net gain for saving e's edge and all descendants is:\n\n1 (for e) + sum of 1 for each descendant (their edges are saved) - cost_e.\n\nSo the total gain is (1 + number of descendants) - cost_e.\n\nBut the cost_e includes the main edges overlapping e's interval (and thus all descendants' intervals).\n\nThus, for a reserve edge e, when we save it, we can consider the entire subtree of e in the reserve tree and calculate the gain as (number of edges in the subtree) - cost_e.\n\nThis is possible because saving e's edge automatically saves all edges in its subtree.\n\nSo, the decision for e is whether to save it and its entire subtree, gaining (number of edges in subtree) - cost_e, or not to save e and instead save some of its children's edges, gaining the sum of the gains from the children's best options.\n\nThis leads to a dynamic programming approach where for each node e:\n\ndp[e] = max( (subtree_size(e) - cost_e), sum of dp[children of e] )\n\nHere, subtree_size(e) is the number of edges in e's subtree (including e itself).\n\nBut how do we compute subtree_size(e) for each node? This is simply the number of edges in the subtree rooted at e. For example, the root's subtree_size is the total number of edges in the reserve tree.\n\nBut the reserve tree is built from the input. So, for each node, we need to precompute the size of its subtree.\n\nThe cost_e is the number of main edges whose intervals overlap with e's interval.\n\nSo, the steps would be:\n\n1. For each tree (main and reserve), build the tree structure and for each edge, compute its interval [l, r].\n\n2. For each edge in the reserve tree, compute its subtree size (number of edges in its subtree).\n\n3. For each edge in the reserve tree, compute cost_e: the number of main edges whose intervals overlap with e's interval.\n\n4. For each reserve edge, compute the maximum gain between saving it (gain is subtree_size(e) - cost_e) or not saving it and taking the sum of gains from its children.\n\nThis dynamic programming approach will give the maximum possible gain, which can be used to compute the minimal sum.\n\nOnce we have the maximum gain, the minimal sum is (main_edges + reserve_edges) - maximum_gain. Then, the answer is (a-1 + b-1) - (main_edges + reserve_edges - maximum_gain) = maximum_gain - (a-1 + b-1) + (a-1 + b-1) - (main_edges + reserve_edges - maximum_gain) ?\n\nWait, no. The total sum of edges kept is (sum_main_edges_kept + sum_reserve_edges_kept). The sum_main_edges_kept is the number of main edges whose intervals intersect S. The sum_reserve_edges_kept is the number of reserve edges whose intervals are not subsets of S.\n\nThe total edges kept is sum_main_kept + sum_reserve_kept.\n\nThe maximum gain is (sum_reserve_saved + sum_main_saved). sum_reserve_saved is the number of reserve edges whose intervals are subsets of S. sum_main_saved is the number of main edges whose intervals do not intersect S.\n\nThe maximum_gain = sum_reserve_saved + sum_main_saved.\n\nBut sum_reserve_saved is the number of reserve edges saved (i.e., not counted in sum_reserve_kept). sum_reserve_kept = reserve_edges - sum_reserve_saved.\n\nsum_main_saved is the number of main edges saved (i.e., not counted in sum_main_kept). sum_main_kept = main_edges - sum_main_saved.\n\nSo, the sum kept is (main_edges - sum_main_saved) + (reserve_edges - sum_reserve_saved) = (main_edges + reserve_edges) - (sum_main_saved + sum_reserve_saved) = (main_edges + reserve_edges) - maximum_gain.\n\nThus, the answer is (a-1 + b-1) - [(main_edges + reserve_edges) - maximum_gain] = (a-1 + b-1) - main_edges - reserve_edges + maximum_gain.\n\nBut a-1 is the number of main edges (since the main tree has a nodes, and a-1 edges). Similarly, b-1 is the number of reserve edges. So, main_edges = a-1, reserve_edges = b-1. Thus, the total edges is (a-1) + (b-1) = a + b - 2.\n\nThe answer is (a + b - 2) - ( (a-1 + b-1) - maximum_gain ) ) = maximum_gain.\n\nWait, no:\n\nOriginal answer is total edges (a-1 + b-1) minus the edges kept. The edges kept is (main_edges_kept + reserve_edges_kept) = (main_edges_kept + reserve_edges_kept). Which is equal to (main_edges - sum_main_saved) + (reserve_edges - sum_reserve_saved) = (a-1 + b-1) - (sum_main_saved + sum_reserve_saved) = (a-1 + b-1) - maximum_gain.\n\nThus, the answer is (a-1 + b-1) - [ (a-1 + b-1) - maximum_gain ] = maximum_gain.\n\nSo the answer is simply the maximum gain.\n\nSo, the approach is to compute the maximum gain (sum of saved main and reserve edges) using the dynamic programming approach on the reserve tree.\n\nThus, the steps are:\n\n1. For each tree (main and reserve), build the tree and for each edge, compute the interval [l, r] of devices.\n\n2. For each edge in the reserve tree, compute the number of main edges whose intervals overlap with it. This is cost_e.\n\n3. Compute the dynamic programming on the reserve tree to find the maximum gain, which is the sum of (subtree_size(e) - cost_e) for the chosen edges plus any other gains.\n\nWait, the DP for the reserve tree is computed as follows:\n\nFor each node e in the reserve tree:\n\ndp[e] = max( (subtree_size(e) - cost_e), sum(dp[child] for all children of e) )\n\nsubtree_size(e) is the number of edges in e's subtree (including e).\n\nThis is because:\n\n- If we choose to save e, we gain 1 for e and 1 for each edge in its subtree. However, the cost is cost_e (number of main edges overlapping e's interval). So, the net gain is (subtree_size(e) - cost_e).\n\n- If we do not save e, we can choose to save some of its children, and the gain is the sum of the maximum gains of the children.\n\nThus, the recurrence is as stated.\n\nOnce the DP is computed, the maximum gain is dp[root_of_reserve_tree], which is the maximum possible sum of saved edges (main and reserve).\n\nThe answer is this maximum gain.\n\nSo, the steps are:\n\n- Build the main and reserve trees, compute their intervals.\n\n- For each edge in the reserve tree, compute the cost_e.\n\n- Compute the subtree sizes for each edge in the reserve tree.\n\n- Perform a post-order traversal of the reserve tree, computing dp[e] as the maximum between saving e (subtree_size(e) - cost_e) or the sum of the children's dp values.\n\nThe maximum gain is the dp[root].\n\nThen, the answer is this maximum gain.\n\nSo, the plan is:\n\n1. Parse the main and reserve trees.\n\nFor each tree:\n\n- The nodes are built from the input. Each node's parent is given in the input. For the main tree, the nodes are 1 to a, with the parent list given as p_i. The main tree is built by iterating through the parent list.\n\n- For each node in the tree, compute the interval [l, r] of devices that are in its subtree. Since the leaves are ordered in a DFS order, the interval for a node is the range of devices connected to the leaves in its subtree.\n\nBut how to compute the intervals for each node?\n\nEach tree has exactly n leaves, which are connected to devices 1..n in the order of the DFS traversal. So, the leaves are ordered 1..n. For a node in the tree, its interval is the range of leaves (devices) in its subtree.\n\nTo compute this, we can perform a DFS traversal of the tree, recording the order in which leaves are visited. For each node, the interval is the minimum and maximum leaf index in its subtree.\n\nFor example, during the DFS of the main tree:\n\n- For each node, when we visit its children in order, the leaves in the subtree of each child are contiguous ranges. So, the interval for a node is the union of its children's intervals.\n\nSo, we can compute the intervals for each node recursively.\n\nLet's think about how to compute the intervals for each node in a tree.\n\nFor the main tree:\n\n- The leaves are the nodes with no children. The devices are connected to the leaves in the order 1..n.\n\n- So, during a DFS traversal of the tree, the leaves are visited in the order 1..n. So, the leaves can be assigned indices 1..n in the order they are visited.\n\nBut how to map the x_i (nodes in main grid connected to device i) to the leaves.\n\nWait, the input gives x_i for each device i, which is the node in the main tree connected to device i. Since the leaves are exactly the devices, each x_i must be a leaf node.\n\nSo, the main tree's leaves are the nodes in x_1 to x_n. Similarly for the reserve tree.\n\nBut the problem states that the leaves are ordered such that a DFS traversal visits them in order 1..n. So, during the DFS, the first leaf encountered is device 1, the second device 2, etc.\n\nSo, to compute the intervals for each node, we can perform a DFS traversal of the tree and record the order in which leaves are visited. For each node, the interval is the range of leaf indices (device numbers) in its subtree.\n\nThis can be done as follows:\n\nFor each tree (main or reserve):\n\n- Perform a DFS traversal. During the traversal, when a leaf is encountered, assign it the next available device number (starting at 1). This way, the leaves are ordered 1..n in the DFS order.\n\n- For each node, during the traversal, track the minimum and maximum device number encountered in its subtree. This gives the interval [l, r].\n\nOnce the intervals are computed for all nodes in both trees, we can proceed.\n\nNow, for each edge in the reserve tree, compute cost_e, which is the number of main edges whose intervals overlap with e's interval.\n\nFor example, for a reserve edge e with interval [l_e, r_e], cost_e is the number of main edges whose intervals have a non-empty intersection with [l_e, r_e].\n\nTo compute this efficiently:\n\n- For each main edge, store its interval [l_m, r_m].\n\n- For each reserve edge e, iterate through all main edges and count those where [l_m, r_m] overlaps with [l_e, r_e]. Overlap means that there exists some device in both intervals.\n\nBut with n up to 1000, and each tree having up to 2000 edges, this would be O(M * R), where M is the number of main edges (a-1) and R is the number of reserve edges (b-1). For a=2000 and b=2000, this would be 2000*2000 = 4 million operations, which is manageable.\n\nBut perhaps there's a more efficient way.\n\nAlternatively, for each main edge, precompute the intervals and build a segment tree or interval tree that allows querying the number of intervals that overlap with a given [l, r]. Then, for each reserve edge e, query this structure with e's interval to get the count.\n\nBut given the time constraints and the manageable size, a brute-force approach might be acceptable.\n\nSo, the steps are:\n\nFor each reserve edge e with interval [l_e, r_e]:\n\ncost_e = 0\n\nFor each main edge m with interval [l_m, r_m]:\n\nif intervals [l_e, r_e] and [l_m, r_m] overlap, increment cost_e.\n\nOnce cost_e is computed for all reserve edges, proceed.\n\nNext, compute the subtree sizes for each reserve edge. This can be done via a post-order traversal of the reserve tree, counting the number of edges in each subtree.\n\nFinally, compute the dynamic programming values for each reserve edge:\n\ndp[e] = max( (subtree_size(e) - cost_e), sum of dp[children of e] )\n\nThe maximum gain is the dp value of the root of the reserve tree.\n\nThe answer is this maximum gain.\n\nNow, let's think about how to implement this.\n\nFirst, building the trees and computing the intervals.\n\nFor each tree:\n\n- The nodes are numbered from 1 to a (for main) or 1 to b (for reserve).\n\n- The parent list for the main tree is given as p_i for node 2 to a. For the main tree, node 1 is the root.\n\n- For each node, we need to build the tree structure (children).\n\nThen, perform a DFS to assign the device indices to the leaves, and compute the intervals for each node.\n\nBut how to identify the leaves? The leaves are the nodes that are connected to the devices, i.e., the x_i and y_i values. For the main tree, the leaves are the nodes in x_1 to x_n, but this may not be the case. Wait, no. The problem statement says that each grid has exactly n leaves, which are connected to the devices. So, each x_i (main tree) and y_i (reserve tree) must be leaves.\n\nSo, during the tree construction, the leaves are those nodes with no children.\n\nSo, during the tree construction:\n\nFor the main tree:\n\n- Build the tree structure from the parent list. Each node's children are those nodes whose parent is the current node.\n\n- Leaves are nodes with no children.\n\nBut the x_i list gives which leaf in the main tree is connected to device i. The problem states that the leaves are visited in device order 1..n during the DFS traversal.\n\nThus, during the DFS traversal of the main tree, the leaves are visited in the order 1..n. So, when a leaf is encountered during DFS, it is assigned to device i, and i is incremented.\n\nBut how to ensure that the x_i list matches the device order.\n\nWait, the problem says that the input is guaranteed that for each tree, there exists a DFS order that visits the leaves in the order of the devices. So, the x_i list for the main tree (which gives the leaf nodes connected to each device) must correspond to the order in which the leaves are visited during such a DFS.\n\nThus, when we perform a DFS of the main tree, the leaves are visited in device order 1..n. So, during the DFS, whenever a leaf is visited (i.e., a node with no children is found), it is assigned to the next device number. So, the first leaf visited is device 1, the second is device 2, etc.\n\nSimilarly for the reserve tree.\n\nThus, during the DFS of the main tree, we can assign device numbers to the leaves. Then, for each device i, the x_i in the input should be the leaf node assigned to device i. But since the input x_i is given as per the problem's guarantee, we don't need to use it for anything except verification. However, since the problem states that the input is correct, we don't need to process x_i and y_i except to build the interval for each node.\n\nWait, no. The x_i list gives the node in the main tree connected to device i. But according to the DFS order, the first leaf visited in the main tree is connected to device 1, etc. So, during the DFS of the main tree, we can collect the leaves in order and store their node numbers. Then, for each device i, x_i must be the i-th leaf in this list.\n\nBut perhaps we don't need to process x_i and y_i except for verification. Since the problem statement says that the input is correct, perhaps we can ignore them and proceed.\n\nBut to compute the intervals for each node, we need to know which leaves are in each node's subtree. So, during the DFS of the main tree, for each node, we track the leaves in its subtree. The first leaf encountered is device 1, the second device 2, etc. So, for each node, the interval is [min_device, max_device], where min_device is the first leaf in its subtree and max_device is the last.\n\nThis can be done by modifying the DFS to track the minimum and maximum device indices in each node's subtree.\n\nSo, here's the plan for building the intervals:\n\nFor the main tree:\n\n- Perform a DFS starting at node 1. When a leaf is encountered (a node with no children), assign it a device number starting from 1 and incrementing each time.\n\n- For each node, during the DFS, track the minimum and maximum device numbers in its subtree. This is done by initializing min and max to infinity and -infinity, and for each child of the node, updating min and max with the child's min and max. For a leaf node, min and max are the device number.\n\nThis will give each node an interval [l, r] representing the device numbers in its subtree.\n\nThe same is done for the reserve tree.\n\nOnce the intervals are computed for both trees, we can proceed.\n\nNext, for each edge in the reserve tree, compute cost_e: the number of main edges whose intervals overlap with the reserve edge's interval.\n\nThen, compute the subtree sizes for each reserve edge.\n\nFinally, compute the DP on the reserve tree.\n\nNow, let's think about the implementation steps.\n\nFirst, parsing the input.\n\nRead n.\n\nThen, read a, the main tree's node count. Then, read a-1 parents p_i. The main tree has nodes 1..a. The parent list p_i is for nodes 2 to a. For example, p_i is the parent of node i+1.\n\nThen, read x_1 to x_n: for each device i, the main tree's leaf node connected to it.\n\nBut according to the problem statement, the main tree's leaves are the x_i nodes, but during the DFS, the leaves are ordered 1..n. So, during the DFS of the main tree, the first leaf encountered is device 1 (x_1), the second is device 2 (x_2), etc. However, the actual node numbers in the main tree's leaves may be arbitrary. So, during the DFS, the leaves are visited in the order 1..n, and their node numbers are stored in a list. Then, x_i should be equal to the i-th element in this list. But since the problem states that the input is correct, we don't need to verify this.\n\nSo, during the DFS of the main tree, we can collect the leaves in order and assign them device numbers 1..n. But the x_i list is the same as this list, but we don't need to use it for anything except to assign the device numbers.\n\nWait, perhaps not. The x_i list is the list of nodes in the main tree that are connected to device i. For example, device 1 is connected to x_1, which is a leaf in the main tree. So, during the DFS, the first leaf encountered is assigned to device 1, which is x_1, then the second leaf is x_2, and so on.\n\nThus, during the DFS, the order in which the leaves are visited is the same as the device order. So, the list of leaves encountered during the DFS is [x_1, x_2, ..., x_n].\n\nThus, during the DFS, when a leaf is encountered, it is added to a list, and this list should match the x_i list. But since the input is correct, we can proceed.\n\nBut for the purpose of building the intervals, the device numbers are assigned in the order of the DFS. So, for each leaf in the main tree, during the DFS, the first one encountered is device 1, second device 2, etc. So, the leaf's interval is [i, i], where i is the device number.\n\nSo, during the DFS for the main tree, each leaf's interval is [i, i], and the non-leaf nodes have intervals that are the union of their children's intervals.\n\nThe same applies to the reserve tree.\n\nThus, the code to build the intervals is as follows:\n\nFor each tree:\n\n- Build the tree structure (children list for each node).\n\n- Perform a DFS to assign device numbers to leaves and compute intervals.\n\nOnce the intervals are computed for each node, for each edge in the reserve tree, compute cost_e.\n\nThen, compute the subtree sizes for each reserve edge.\n\nFinally, compute the DP.\n\nNow, the code structure.\n\nFirst, struct to represent a tree node with interval and children.\n\nBut in code, we can represent each tree as a list of nodes, each with:\n\n- children: list of child nodes.\n\n- interval [l, r].\n\n- for the reserve tree, also need to track the subtree size and cost_e.\n\nBut in code, we can process each tree as follows:\n\nFor the main tree:\n\nstruct Node {\n    int l, r;\n    vector<int> children;\n};\n\nvector<Node> main_tree;\n\nFor the reserve tree:\n\nstruct ReserveNode {\n    int l, r;\n    vector<int> children;\n    int cost;\n    int subtree_size;\n    int dp;\n};\n\nvector<ReserveNode> reserve_tree;\n\nBut in practice, it's easier to represent the trees using adjacency lists and separate structures for the intervals.\n\nBut let's proceed step by step.\n\nImplementing the DFS for each tree:\n\nFor the main tree:\n\n- Build the tree structure from the parent list.\n\n- During DFS, assign device numbers to leaves and compute intervals.\n\nBut the device numbers are assigned in the order the leaves are visited during DFS.\n\nFor example, for the main tree:\n\n1. Read the parent list for nodes 2 to a.\n\n2. Build the adjacency list: for each node, list its children.\n\n3. Perform a DFS starting from node 1. When visiting a node, if it has no children (leaf), assign it the next available device number. For non-leaf nodes, collect the intervals from children.\n\nSo, the code for building the main tree's intervals:\n\nvector<int> main_leaves;\n\nfunction<pair<int, int>(int, vector<vector<int>>&)> dfs = [&](int u, vector<vector<int>>& adj) -> pair<int, int> {\n    if (adj[u].empty()) { // leaf node\n        main_leaves.push_back(u);\n        int device = main_leaves.size();\n        return {device, device};\n    }\n    int min_l = numeric_limits<int>::max();\n    int max_r = -1;\n    for (int v : adj[u]) {\n        auto [l, r] = dfs(v, adj);\n        min_l = min(min_l, l);\n        max_r = max(max_r, r);\n    }\n    return {min_l, max_r};\n};\n\nThen, after building the adjacency list adj for the main tree, we call dfs(1, adj). The intervals are stored in a vector for each node.\n\nBut the main_leaves list will collect the nodes in the order they were visited (device 1 to n). Then, the x_i list given in the input should match main_leaves[i-1] for each i. But since the input is correct, we can ignore this.\n\nSimilarly for the reserve tree.\n\nOnce the intervals are computed for both trees, the next step is to compute cost_e for each reserve edge.\n\nFor each reserve edge e (each node in the reserve tree, except the root?), wait, each node in the reserve tree represents an edge. Wait, no. The reserve tree's nodes are the nodes in the tree structure, and each edge is from parent to child. So, each node in the tree (except the root) has an edge from its parent to itself. So, the edges are represented by the parent-child relationships.\n\nThus, for each node in the reserve tree (except the root), there's an edge from the parent to this node. So, the edge's interval is the same as the node's interval. So, to compute cost_e for each edge in the reserve tree, we can process each node (except the root) and use its interval.\n\nBut the root node in the reserve tree has no parent, so there's no edge for it. Wait, the root node is node 1 in the reserve tree. The edges are from p_i to node i+1 for the reserve tree. So, the edges are for nodes 2 to b. Each edge has a parent, and the interval of the edge is the interval of the child node.\n\nSo, for each node in the reserve tree (except the root), the edge is from its parent to itself, and the interval is the node's interval.\n\nThus, when processing the reserve tree's edges, we can iterate over all nodes except the root, and for each such node, the interval is the node's [l, r].\n\nThus, for each node in the reserve tree (except the root), compute cost_e as the number of main edges whose intervals overlap with [l, r].\n\nBut the main edges are the nodes in the main tree (except the root), and their intervals are [l_m, r_m].\n\nSo, for each reserve node (except root), iterate over all main nodes (except root), and count how many main nodes have intervals overlapping with the reserve node's interval.\n\nBut wait, the edges in the main tree are represented by the parent-child relationships, and the interval of the edge is the child's interval. So, the main edges are the child nodes in the main tree. For example, for node v in the main tree (except root), the edge from its parent p to v has an interval [l_v, r_v].\n\nThus, for the main tree, the edges are represented by the child nodes. So, for each child node v in the main tree, the edge from p to v has an interval [l_v, r_v].\n\nThus, to process the main edges, we can collect all child nodes (nodes 2 to a), and for each, the interval is their [l, r].\n\nSo, the code for collecting main edges:\n\nvector<pair<int, int>> main_edges_intervals;\n\nfor (int v = 2; v <= a; ++v) { // main tree nodes 2 to a\n    main_edges_intervals.emplace_back(main_tree[v].l, main_tree[v].r);\n}\n\nThen, for each reserve node (except root), compute cost_e:\n\nfor each reserve_node in reserve_tree (nodes 2 to b):\n\n    l_e = reserve_tree[reserve_node].l;\n    r_e = reserve_tree[reserve_node].r;\n\n    cost_e = 0;\n\n    for each (l_m, r_m) in main_edges_intervals:\n\n        if (l_e <= r_m && l_m <= r_e) { // intervals overlap\n            cost_e++;\n        }\n\nreserve_tree[reserve_node].cost = cost_e;\n\nBut wait, the reserve_tree is built similarly to the main tree. For each node in the reserve_tree, the interval is [l, r].\n\nSo, for each reserve node (except root), which represents an edge from its parent to itself, the interval is [l, r], and the cost_e is the number of main edges (main child nodes) whose intervals overlap with [l, r].\n\nNow, compute the subtree sizes for each reserve node.\n\nThis can be done via a post-order traversal of the reserve tree. For each node, the subtree size is 1 plus the sum of the subtree sizes of its children.\n\nThus, code:\n\nfunction<int(int)> compute_subtree_size = [&](int u) -> int {\n    int size = 1;\n    for (int v : reserve_adj[u]) {\n        size += compute_subtree_size(v);\n    }\n    reserve_tree[u].subtree_size = size;\n    return size;\n};\n\ncompute_subtree_size(1);\n\nAssuming that reserve_adj is the adjacency list for the reserve tree.\n\nThen, compute the DP for each node.\n\nThe DP is computed via a post-order traversal as well. For each node, compute the maximum between (subtree_size - cost) and the sum of the DP of its children.\n\nThus:\n\nfunction<int(int)> compute_dp = [&](int u) -> int {\n    int option1 = reserve_tree[u].subtree_size - reserve_tree[u].cost;\n    int option2 = 0;\n    for (int v : reserve_adj[u]) {\n        option2 += compute_dp(v);\n    }\n    return reserve_tree[u].dp = max(option1, option2);\n};\n\nint max_gain = compute_dp(1);\n\nFinally, the answer is max_gain.\n\nThus, putting this all together.\n\nNow, the code.\n\nBut let's think about the data structures.\n\nFirst, build the main tree:\n\nRead a, then read a-1 parents p_i for nodes 2 to a. Build the adjacency list. Then perform DFS to assign intervals.\n\nSame for reserve tree.\n\nBut how to represent the main and reserve trees.\n\nFor each tree, we'll have an adjacency list (children) and a vector of intervals for each node.\n\nIn code:\n\nstruct TreeInfo {\n    vector<vector<int>> adj;\n    vector<pair<int, int>> intervals;\n    vector<int> leaves;\n};\n\nTreeInfo build_tree(int num_nodes, const vector<int>& parents) {\n    TreeInfo tree;\n    tree.adj.resize(num_nodes + 1); // nodes are 1-based\n    for (int i = 0; i < parents.size(); ++i) {\n        int node = i + 2;\n        int parent = parents[i];\n        tree.adj[parent].push_back(node);\n    }\n\n    tree.leaves.clear();\n    tree.intervals.resize(num_nodes + 1, {0, 0});\n\n    function<pair<int, int>(int)> dfs = [&](int u) -> pair<int, int> {\n        if (tree.adj[u].empty()) { // leaf\n            tree.leaves.push_back(u);\n            int device = tree.leaves.size();\n            return {device, device};\n        }\n        int min_l = INT_MAX;\n        int max_r = -1;\n        for (int v : tree.adj[u]) {\n            auto [l, r] = dfs(v);\n            min_l = min(min_l, l);\n            max_r = max(max_r, r);\n        }\n        return {min_l, max_r};\n    };\n\n    auto [root_l, root_r] = dfs(1);\n    tree.intervals[1] = {root_l, root_r};\n\n    for (int u = 2; u <= num_nodes; ++u) {\n        // for each node, the interval is already computed during dfs\n        // but how?\n        // need to modify dfs to store intervals for all nodes\n        // Wait, the current dfs returns the interval for u, but in the code above, it's stored only for the root.\n\n        // Need to modify the dfs to store the interval for each node.\n\n        // Correcting the dfs:\n\n        // The initial code for dfs only returns the interval for the root.

Their intervals are their [l, r].\n\nSo:\n\nvector<pair<int, int>> main_edges_intervals;\n\nfor (int u = 2; u <= a; ++u) {\n    main_edges_intervals.emplace_back(main_tree_info.intervals[u].first, main_tree_info.intervals[u].second);\n}\n\nThen, for the reserve tree, process each node (except root) and compute cost_e:\n\nreserve_tree_info.adj contains the adjacency list for the reserve tree.\n\nFor each node u in reserve_tree_info.adj (except root node 1):\n\nauto [l, r] = reserve_tree_info.intervals[u];\n\ncompute cost_e by checking overlap with each main edge's interval.\n\nThen, compute subtree sizes for each reserve node.\n\nThen, compute the DP.\n\nFinally, the answer is the DP value for the root of the reserve tree.\n\nPutting this all together:\n\nThe code:\n\n#include <bits/stdc++.h>\nusing namespace std;\n\nstruct TreeInfo {\n    vector<vector<int>> adj;\n    vector<pair<int, int>> intervals;\n    vector<int> leaves;\n};\n\nTreeInfo build_tree(int num_nodes, const vector<int>& parents) {\n    TreeInfo ti;\n    ti.adj.resize(num_nodes + 1);\n    for (int i = 0; i < parents.size(); ++i) {\n        int u = i + 2;\n        int p = parents[i];\n        ti.adj[p].push_back(u);\n    }\n    ti.intervals.resize(num_nodes + 1);\n    ti.leaves.clear();\n\n    function<pair<int, int>(int)> dfs = [&](int u) {\n        if (ti.adj[u].empty()) {\n            ti.leaves.push_back(u);\n            int device = ti.leaves.size();\n            ti.intervals[u] = {device, device};\n            return make_pair(device, device);\n        }\n        int min_l = INT_MAX, max_r = -1;\n        for (int v : ti.adj[u]) {\n            auto [l, r] = dfs(v);\n            min_l = min(min_l, l);\n            max_r = max(max_r, r);\n        }\n        ti.intervals[u] = {min_l, max_r};\n        return make_pair(min_l, max_r);\n    };\n\n    dfs(1);\n    return ti;\n}\n\nint main() {\n    ios::sync_with_stdio(false);\n    cin.tie(nullptr);\n\n    int n;\n    cin >> n;\n\n    // Build main tree\n    int a;\n    cin >> a;\n    vector<int> main_parents(a-1);\n    for (int& p : main_parents) cin >> p;\n    TreeInfo main_info = build_tree(a, main_parents);\n    vector<int> x(n);\n    for (int& xi : x) cin >> xi;\n\n    // Build reserve tree\n    int b;\n    cin >> b;\n    vector<int> reserve_parents(b-1);\n    for (int& p : reserve_parents) cin >> p;\n    TreeInfo reserve_info = build_tree(b, reserve_parents);\n    vector<int> y(n);\n    for (int& yi : y) cin >> yi;\n\n    // Collect main edges' intervals (nodes 2 to a)\n    vector<pair<int, int>> main_edges;\n    for (int u = 2; u <= a; ++u) {\n        main_edges.emplace_back(main_info.intervals[u].first, main_info.intervals[u].second);\n    }\n\n    // Compute cost for each reserve edge (nodes 2 to b)\n    vector<int> cost(b + 1, 0); // cost[u] is for node u (u >= 2)\n    for (int u = 2; u <= b; ++u) {\n        auto [l, r] = reserve_info.intervals[u];\n        int cnt = 0;\n        for (auto [ml, mr] : main_edges) {\n            if (l <= mr && ml <= r) {\n                ++cnt;\n            }\n        }\n        cost[u] = cnt;\n    }\n\n    // Compute subtree sizes for reserve tree\n    vector<int> subtree_size(b + 1, 0);\n    function<int(int)> calc_subtree = [&](int u) {\n        int size = 1;\n        for (int v : reserve_info.adj[u]) {\n            size += calc_subtree(v);\n        }\n        subtree_size[u] = size;\n        return size;\n    };\n    calc_subtree(1);\n\n    // Compute DP\n    vector<int> dp(b + 1, 0);\n    function<int(int)> compute_dp = [&](int u) {\n        if (u != 1 && reserve_info.adj[u].empty()) {\n            // Leaf node in reserve tree.

So, when computing the DP for the reserve tree, the root node's children are the nodes directly connected to it, and their edges are part of the reserve tree's edges.\n\nBut the DP for the root is computed as the sum of the DP values of its children. Because the root's edge does not exist. So, the code handles this by not considering the option1 for the root.\n\nBut in the code above, when u is the root (1), the option1 is subtree_size[u] - cost[u]. But subtree_size[u] is the size of the entire reserve tree (number of edges, which is b-1), and cost[u] is zero (since u=1 is not in the cost array).\n\nBut this is incorrect. The root node's subtree size is the number of edges in the entire tree (b-1), but the root's edge does not exist (since edges are parent to child, and the root has no parent). So, the root node's subtree size should not be considered. Thus, the code for the root node's DP is simply the sum of its children's DP values.\n\nBut the code for compute_dp(u) for the root is:\n\nif (u == 1) {\n    dp[u] = option2; // option2 is sum of children's DPs\n} else {\n    dp[u] = max(option1, option2);\n}\n\nYes. So, the root's DP is the sum of the DPs of its children, which corresponds to not saving the root (since it has no edge), and thus saving some of its children's edges.\n\nThis should be correct.\n\nThus, the code should compute the correct maximum gain.\n\nTesting this code against the examples.\n\nFirst example:\n\nInput:\n3\n6\n4 1 1 4 2\n6 5 3\n4\n1 1 1\n3 4 2\n\nThe main tree has 6 nodes. The parent list is [4, 1, 1, 4, 2] for nodes 2-6.\n\nBuilding the main tree:\n\nNode 1's children are node 4 (since parents[0] =4 for node 2?), wait wait, the parents list is for nodes 2,3,4,5,6.\n\nWait, for the main tree, the parents list is given for nodes 2 to a (6). The parents are given in order for node 2,3,4,5,6. So:\n\nnode 2's parent is 4.\n\nnode 3's parent is 1.\n\nnode 4's parent is 1.\n\nnode 5's parent is 4.\n\nnode 6's parent is 2.\n\nThe main tree's adjacency list for each node:\n\n1: children are 3,4.\n\n4: children are 2,5.\n\n2: children are 6.\n\n3: no children (leaf).\n\n5: no children (leaf).\n\n6: no children (leaf).\n\nDFS of main tree:\n\nStarts at 1.\n\nVisits 3 (leaf), device 1.\n\nVisits 4.\n\nVisits 2.\n\nVisits 6 (leaf), device 2.\n\nVisits 5 (leaf), device 3.\n\nThus, the leaves in order are 3,6,5. The x_i list is [6,5,3]. So, device 1 is connected to node 6, device 2 to node 5, and device 3 to node 3.\n\nBut according to the problem's first example, the main tree's leaves are in the order of devices 1, 2, 3.\n\nBut according to our code's dfs, the leaves are visited in the order 3 (device 1), 6 (device 2), 5 (device 3). So, x_1 is 6, x_2 is 5, x_3 is 3.\n\nWhich matches the input's x list: 6,5,3.\n\nThe intervals for the main tree's edges (nodes 2-6):\n\nNode 2's interval is [2, 2] (device 2).\n\nNode 3's interval is [1, 1].\n\nNode 4's interval is [2, 3].\n\nNode 5's interval is [3, 3].\n\nNode 6's interval is [2, 2].\n\nMain edges' intervals:\n\nnodes 2-6: their intervals are:\n\nnode 2: [2,2]\n\nnode 3: [1,1]\n\nnode 4: [2,3]\n\nnode 5: [3,3]\n\nnode 6: [2,2]\n\nThe main_edges_intervals will be:\n\n(2,2), (1,1), (2,3), (3,3), (2,2).\n\nReserve tree:\n\nn=3.\n\nb=4.\n\nparents list is [1, 1, 1] for nodes 2,3,4.\n\nNodes:\n\n1's children are 2,3,4.\n\nEach of those is a leaf? No. Wait, node 2's parent is 1, node 3's parent is 1, node 4's parent is 1. So, the reserve tree has node 1 with children 2,3,4. But each of them is a leaf (since no further children). So during DFS, the leaves are 2,3,4. So, device 1 is connected to node 3 (y_1=3), device 2 to node4 (y_2=4), device3 to node2 (y_3=2).\n\nReserve tree's intervals:\n\nnode 1: [1, 3]\n\nnode 2: [3,3]\n\nnode 3: [1,1]\n\nnode4: [2,2]\n\nReserve edges are nodes 2,3,4.\n\nTheir intervals are:\n\nnode 2: [3,3]\n\nnode3: [1,1]\n\nnode4: [2,2]\n\nCost_e for each reserve edge:\n\nFor node 2 (reserve edge, interval [3,3]):\n\nCheck how many main edges overlap.\n\nMain edges:\n\n(2,2): [2,2] → overlaps with 3? No. So no.\n\n(1,1): [1,1] → no.\n\n(2,3): [2,3] → yes.\n\n(3,3): [3,3] → yes.\n\n(2,2): [2,2] → no.\n\nSo cost_e for node 2 is 2.\n\nFor node3 (reserve edge, interval [1,1]):\n\nCheck main edges:\n\n(2,2) → no.\n\n(1,1) → yes.\n\n(2,3) → yes.\n\n(3,3) → no.\n\n(2,2) → no.\n\nSo overlapping edges are (1,1) and (2,3). So cost_e for node3 is 2.\n\nFor node4 (reserve edge, interval [2,2]):\n\nCheck main edges:\n\n(2,2) → yes.\n\n(1,1) → no.\n\n(2,3) → yes.\n\n(3,3) → no.\n\n(2,2) → yes.\n\nSo overlapping edges are (2,2), (2,3), (2,2). Wait, the main edges are nodes 2,3,4,5,6.\n\nTheir intervals:\n\nnode2: [2,2]\n\nnode3: [1,1]\n\nnode4: [2,3]\n\nnode5: [3,3]\n\nnode6: [2,2]\n\nSo main_edges_intervals are:\n\n(2,2), (1,1), (2,3), (3,3), (2,2).\n\nSo for node4's interval [2,2], overlapping main edges are node2 (2,2), node4 (2,3), node6 (2,2). So count is 3.\n\nSo cost_e for node4 is 3.\n\nNow, the reserve tree's nodes:\n\nRoot is 1, children are 2,3,4.\n\nSubtree sizes:\n\nFor node 2: 1 (leaf).\n\nnode3: 1.\n\nnode4:1.\n\nnode1: 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 (itself?) No. Wait, subtree_size for a node is the number of edges in its subtree. Since each node represents an edge (except the root), the subtree_size for node u is the number of edges in its subtree.\n\nWait, for the reserve tree, the edges are nodes 2,3,4. Each is a child of the root (node 1).\n\nThe subtree_size for node 2 is 1 (the edge itself).\n\nThe subtree_size for node 3 is 1.\n\nThe subtree_size for node4 is 1.\n\nThe subtree_size for node1 is the sum of its children's subtree_size (1+1+1) plus 0 (since root has no edge). So, subtree_size for node1 is 3 (number of edges in the reserve tree).\n\nBut the code's calc_subtree function:\n\nfunction<int(int)> calc_subtree = [&](int u) {\n    int size = 1;\n    for (int v : reserve_info.adj[u]) {\n        size += calc_subtree(v);\n    }\n    subtree_size[u] = size;\n    return size;\n};\n\nBut this counts the number of nodes in the subtree, not edges. So, for a tree with 4 nodes (1,2,3,4), each child of 1 (2,3,4) is a leaf. So, the subtree_size for node 1 is 1 (itself) + 1 (node2) + 1 (node3) + 1 (node4) =4. But the number of edges in the reserve tree is 3 (edges 2,3,4). So, this approach is incorrect.\n\nAh, here's the mistake. The code's subtree_size is counting the number of nodes in the subtree, not the number of edges. But each node (except the root) represents an edge. So, the number of edges in the subtree of a node is (number of nodes in the subtree - 1).\n\nBut the code's current calculation of subtree_size[u] is the number of nodes in the subtree rooted at u.\n\nFor example:\n\nnode2's subtree_size is 1 (only itself).\n\nnode1's subtree_size is 4 (nodes 1,2,3,4).\n\nBut the edges in the reserve tree are nodes 2,3,4. So, the root's subtree_size is 4, but the number of edges is 3.\n\nThus, the code's current calculation of subtree_size is incorrect. The subtree_size for a node should be the number of edges in its subtree. For node u (which represents an edge from its parent to u), the subtree_size is 1 plus the sum of the subtree sizes of its children. But since the edge exists only for nodes other than the root.\n\nThus, the correct way to compute the subtree_size for each node is:\n\nFor each node u:\n\n- If u is the root (1), then its subtree_size is the sum of the subtree sizes of its children.\n\n- Else, the subtree_size is 1 (the edge from parent to u) plus the sum of the subtree sizes of its children.\n\nBut this is not correct. Because each node in the reserve tree (except the root) represents an edge.\n\nSo, for each node u in the reserve tree (u != 1), the number of edges in its subtree is 1 (its own edge) plus the sum of the edges in the subtrees of its children.\n\nThe root (u=1) has no edge, so the edges in its subtree are the sum of the edges in the subtrees of its children.\n\nThus, the correct way to compute the subtree_size (number of edges in the subtree) is:\n\nsubtree_size[u] = (u == 1 ? 0 : 1) + sum of subtree_size[v] for all children v of u.\n\nThus, the code for calc_subtree should be modified as follows:\n\nfunction<int(int)> calc_subtree = [&](int u) {\n    int size = (u == 1) ? 0 : 1; // root has no edge\n    for (int v : reserve_info.adj[u]) {\n        size += calc_subtree(v);\n    }\n    subtree_size[u] = size;\n    return size;\n};\n\nIn this way:\n\n- For node 2 (reserve tree), subtree_size[2] = 1 (edge 2) + sum of children's subtree_size. Since node 2 has no children, it's 1.\n\n- For node 1 (root), subtree_size[1] = 0 + sum of subtree_size of children (2,3,4) which are 1+1+1=3. So, subtree_size[1] =3.\n\nThus, the code's subtree_size for the root is 3, which is the correct number of edges in the reserve tree (b=4, so 4-1=3 edges).\n\nThen, for each node u in the reserve tree:\n\n- subtree_size[u] represents the number of edges in its subtree.\n\nThus, the code's calc_subtree function must be corrected as above.\n\nThis is a crucial mistake in the previous code. Fixing this will correct the computation of the subtree sizes.\n\nWith this correction, let's re-calculate the example.\n\nFor the first example:\n\nreserve tree edges are nodes 2,3,4.\n\nsubtree_size[2] = 1.\n\nsubtree_size[3] =1.\n\nsubtree_size[4] =1.\n\nsubtree_size[1] =0 + 1 + 1 +1 =3.\n\nThen, compute the DP:\n\nFor node2:\n\noption1 = subtree_size[2] - cost[2] =1 -2 = -1.\n\noption2 = sum of children's DP (no children, so 0).\n\ndp[2] = max(-1, 0) =0.\n\nFor node3:\n\noption1=1-2 =-1.\n\noption2=0.\n\ndp[3] =0.\n\nFor node4:\n\noption1=1-3 =-2.\n\noption2=0.\n\ndp[4]=0.\n\nFor root node 1:\n\noption1 = subtree_size[1] - cost[1]. But cost[1] is not computed, since node1 is the root and has no edge. So, option1 is not applicable.\n\noption2 = dp[2] + dp[3] + dp[4] =0+0+0=0.\n\nThus, the maximum gain is 0.\n\nBut the sample output is 5.\n\nWait, but according to the first example, the answer is 5.\n\nBut according to this code's calculation, the maximum gain is 0, so the answer is 0. Which is incorrect.\n\nThis indicates a bug in the code.\n\nWhat's wrong here?\n\nLet's re-examine the example.\n\nThe first example's main tree has a-1=5 edges (a=6 nodes). The reserve tree has b-1=3 edges.\n\nTotal edges is 5+3=8.\n\nThe maximum gain is the maximum number of edges that can be saved, which is 5. So the answer is 5.\n\nBut according to the code, the maximum gain is 0. Which is incorrect.\n\nThis indicates a mistake in the code's approach.\n\nLet's re-examine the problem.\n\nThe code's approach is to model the maximum gain as the sum of saved reserve edges and saved main edges.\n\nBut according to the problem, the answer is the maximum number of edges that can be removed. Which is the maximum gain.\n\nBut in the first example, the maximum gain should be 5. So the code's approach is incorrect.\n\nSo what is wrong?\n\nThe mistake must be in the way the cost_e is computed.\n\nLet's re-calculate the cost_e for each reserve edge.\n\nReserve edges are nodes 2,3,4.\n\nNode2's interval is [3,3].\n\nMain edges are:\n\nnode2: [2,2].\n\nnode3: [1,1].\n\nnode4: [2,3].\n\nnode5: [3,3].\n\nnode6: [2,2].\n\nSo main edges' intervals are:\n\n(2,2), (1,1), (2,3), (3,3), (2,2).\n\nFor node2's interval [3,3], overlapping main edges are:\n\n[2,3], [3,3].\n\nSo cost_e=2.\n\nNode3's interval [1,1]:\n\n overlapping main edges: [1,1], [2,3].\n\nSo cost_e=2.\n\nNode4's interval [2,2]:\n\n overlapping main edges: [2,2], [2,3], [2,2].\n\nSo cost_e=3.\n\nSo, for each reserve edge:\n\nnode2: cost=2.\n\nnode3: cost=2.\n\nnode4: cost=3.\n\nsubtree_size for each:\n\nnode2:1.\n\nnode3:1.\n\nnode4:1.\n\nSo option1 for node2: 1-2= -1.\n\noption2: 0. So dp[2]=0.\n\nSimilarly for node3 and node4.\n\nRoot's option2 is 0+0+0=0. So maximum gain is 0. But the sample output is 5.\n\nThis suggests that the code's approach is incorrect.\n\nBut according to the sample input's first example:\n\nThe answer is 5, which is the maximum number of edges that can be removed.\n\nThe total edges are 5 (main) + 3 (reserve) =8. The maximum gain is 5, which would imply that 5 edges are saved (thus, 8-5=3 edges are kept, which gives 5 removed).\n\nBut according to the code's calculation, the maximum gain is 0. So why is this discrepancy?\n\nAh, perhaps",

There are now $$$n$$$ locks, the $$$i$$$-th of them has the volume of $$$v_i$$$ liters, so that it can contain any amount of water between $$$0$$$ and $$$v_i$$$ liters. Each lock has a pipe attached to it. When the pipe is open, $$$1$$$ liter of water enters the lock every second.\n\nThe locks system is built in a way to immediately transfer all water exceeding the volume of the lock $$$i$$$ to the lock $$$i + 1$$$. If the lock $$$i + 1$$$ is also full, water will be transferred further. Water exceeding the volume of the last lock pours out to the river.\n\nThe picture illustrates $$$5$$$ locks with two open pipes at locks $$$1$$$ and $$$3$$$. Because locks $$$1$$$, $$$3$$$, and $$$4$$$ are already filled, effectively the water goes to locks $$$2$$$ and $$$5$$$.\n\nNote that the volume of the $$$i$$$-th lock may be greater than the volume of the $$$i + 1$$$-th lock.\n\nTo make all locks work, you need to completely fill each one of them. The mayor of Divanovo is interested in $$$q$$$ independent queries. For each query, suppose that initially all locks are empty and all pipes are closed. Then, some pipes are opened simultaneously. For the $$$j$$$-th query the mayor asks you to calculate the minimum number of pipes to open so that all locks are filled no later than after $$$t_j$$$ seconds.\n\nPlease help the mayor to solve this tricky problem and answer his queries.\n\nExecution time limit: 2.0 seconds\nMemory limit: 256.0 MB\n\n## Input Format\nThe first lines contains one integer $$$n$$$ ($$$1 \\le n \\le 200\\,000$$$) — the number of locks.\n\nThe second lines contains $$$n$$$ integers $$$v_1, v_2, \\dots, v_n$$$ ($$$1 \\le v_i \\le 10^9$$$)) — volumes of the locks.\n\nThe third line contains one integer $$$q$$$ ($$$1 \\le q \\le 200\\,000$$$) — the number of queries.\n\nEach of the next $$$q$$$ lines contains one integer $$$t_j$$$ ($$$1 \\le t_j \\le 10^9$$$) — the number of seconds you have to fill all the locks in the query $$$j$$$.\n\n## Output Format\nPrint $$$q$$$ integers. The $$$j$$$-th of them should be equal to the minimum number of pipes to turn on so that after $$$t_j$$$ seconds all of the locks are filled. If it is impossible to fill all of the locks in given time, print $$$-1$$$.\n\n## Examples\n```input\n5\n4 1 5 4 1\n6\n1\n6\n2\n3\n4\n5\n```\n```output\n-1\n3\n-1\n-1\n4\n3\n```\n-----\n```input\n5\n4 4 4 4 4\n6\n1\n3\n6\n5\n2\n4\n```\n```output\n-1\n-1\n4\n4\n-1\n5\n```\n\n## Note\nThere are $$$6$$$ queries in the first example test.\n\nIn the queries $$$1, 3, 4$$$ the answer is $$$-1$$$. We need to wait $$$4$$$ seconds to fill the first lock even if we open all the pipes.\n\nIn the sixth query we can open pipes in locks $$$1$$$, $$$3$$$, and $$$4$$$.

The first task given by Dr. Chanek to you is to take care and store his magical stones.\n\nDr. Chanek has $$$N$$$ magical stones with $$$N$$$ being an even number. Those magical stones are numbered from $$$1$$$ to $$$N$$$. Magical stone $$$i$$$ has a strength of $$$A_i$$$. A magical stone can be painted with two colours, namely the colour black or the colour white. You are tasked to paint the magical stones with the colour black or white and store the magical stones into a magic box with a magic coefficient $$$Z$$$ ($$$0 \\leq Z \\leq 2$$$). The painting of the magical stones must be done in a way such that there are $$$\\frac{N}{2}$$$ black magical stones and $$$\\frac{N}{2}$$$ white magical stones.\n\nDefine $$$\\text{concat}(x, y)$$$ for two integers $$$x$$$ and $$$y$$$ as the result of concatenating the digits of $$$x$$$ to the left of $$$y$$$ in their decimal representation without changing the order. As an example, $$$\\text{concat}(10, 24)$$$ will result in $$$1024$$$.\n\nFor a magic box with a magic coefficient $$$Z$$$, magical stone $$$i$$$ will react with magical stone $$$j$$$ if the colours of both stones are different and $$$\\text{concat}(A_i, A_j) \\times \\text{concat}(A_j, A_i) + A_i \\times A_j \\equiv Z \\mod 3$$$. A magical stone that is reacting will be very hot and dangerous. Because of that, you must colour the magical stones and determine the magic coefficient $$$Z$$$ of the magic box in a way such that there is no magical stone that reacts, or report if it is impossible.\n\n## Constraints\nTime limit per test: 1.0 seconds\nMemory limit per test: 256.0 megabytes\n\n## Input Format\nThe first line contains a single even integer $$$N$$$ ($$$2 \\le N \\le 10^5$$$) — the number of magical stones Dr. Chanek has.\n\nThe second line contains $$$N$$$ integer $$$A_1, A_2, \\ldots, A_N$$$ ($$$1 \\leq A_i \\leq 10^9$$$) — the strengths of all magical stones.\n\n## Output Format\nIf it is not possible to satisfy the condition of the problem, output $$$-1$$$.\n\nOtherwise, output two lines. The first line contains an integer $$$Z$$$ denoting the magic coefficient of the magic box. The second line contains a string $$$S$$$ of length $$$N$$$. $$$S_i$$$ is $$$0$$$ if magical stone $$$i$$$ is coloured black or $$$1$$$ if magical stone $$$i$$$ is coloured white. If there are more than one possibilities of colouring and choosing the magic coefficient $$$Z$$$, output any of them.\n\n## Examples\n```input\n4\n4 10 9 14\n```\n```output\n0\n1001\n```\n\n## Note\nBy giving the above colouring, it can be seen that:\n\n- $$$i=1, j=2 \\longrightarrow \\text{concat}(4, 10) \\times \\text{concat}(10, 4) + 10 \\times 4 = 410 \\times 104 + 40 = 42680 \\equiv 2 \\mod 3$$$\n- $$$i=1, j=3 \\longrightarrow \\text{concat}(4, 9) \\times \\text{concat}(9, 4) + 4 \\times 9 = 49 \\times 94 + 36 = 4642 \\equiv 1 \\mod 3$$$\n- $$$i=4, j=2 \\longrightarrow \\text{concat}(14, 10) \\times \\text{concat}(10, 14) + 10 \\times 14 = 1410 \\times 1014 + 140 = 1429880 \\equiv 2 \\mod 3$$$\n- $$$i=4, j=3 \\longrightarrow \\text{concat}(14, 9) \\times \\text{concat}(9, 14) + 14 \\times 9 = 149 \\times 914 + 126 = 136312 \\equiv 1 \\mod 3$$$\n\nBecause of that, by choosing $$$Z = 0$$$, it can be guaranteed that there is no magical stone that reacts.\n\n## Editorial\nNotice that $$$10 \\equiv 1 \\mod 3$$$. Hence, if $$$k$$$ denotes the number of digits in $$$A_j$$$, $$$\\text{concat}(A_i, A_j) \\mod 3= (A_i \\times 10^k + A_j) \\mod 3 = (A_i \\times 1^k + A_j) \\mod 3 = (A_i + A_j) \\mod 3$$$.\nThen one can simplify the equation that determines the reaction of stone $$$i$$$ and stone $$$j$$$ as follows. $$$$$$ \\begin{align} \\text{concat}(A_i, A_j) \\times \\text{concat}(A_j, A_i) + A_i A_j & \\equiv Z \\mod 3 \\\\ (A_i + A_j) (A_i + A_j) + A_i A_j & \\equiv Z \\mod 3 \\\\ A_i^2 + 2 A_i A_j + A_j^2 + A_i A_j & \\equiv Z \\mod 3 \\\\ A_i^2 + A_j^2 + 3 A_i A_j & \\equiv Z \\mod 3 \\\\ A_i^2 + A_j^2 & \\equiv Z \\mod 3 \\\\ \\end{align} $$$$$$ One can see that:\n• $$$0^2 = 0 \\equiv 0 \\mod 3$$$.\n• $$$1^2 = 1 \\equiv 1 \\mod 3$$$.\n• $$$2^2 = 4 \\equiv 1 \\mod 3$$$.\nSo the value of $$$A_i^2 \\mod 3$$$ is either $$$0$$$ or $$$1$$$.\nWe can get a construction that consists of the two following cases:\n• If there are at least $$$\\frac{N}{2}$$$ stones having $$$A_i^2 \\equiv 0 \\mod 3$$$, then we can colour the stones such that one of the colours only occurs in all stones with $$$A_i^2 \\equiv 0 \\mod 3$$$. In this construction, there is no pair of stones with different colours that both have $$$A_i^2 \\equiv 1 \\mod 3$$$. So we can assign $$$Z=2$$$.\n• If there are less than $$$\\frac{N}{2}$$$ stones having $$$A_i^2 \\equiv 0 \\mod 3$$$, then there are at least $$$\\frac{N}{2}$$$ stones having $$$A_i^2 \\equiv 1 \\mod 3$$$, so we can colour the stones such that one of the colours only occurs in all stones with $$$A_i^2 \\equiv 1 \\mod 3$$$. In this construction, there is no pair of stones with different colours that both have $$$A_i^2 \\equiv 0 \\mod 3$$$. So we can assign $$$Z=0$$$.\nTime complexity: $$$O(N)$$$\n",

Petya's got n non-transparent glasses, standing in a row. The glasses' positions are indexed with integers from 1 to n from left to right. Note that the positions are indexed but the glasses are not.\n\nFirst Petya puts a marble under the glass in position s. Then he performs some (possibly zero) shuffling operations. One shuffling operation means moving the glass from the first position to position p1, the glass from the second position to position p2 and so on. That is, a glass goes from position i to position pi. Consider all glasses are moving simultaneously during one shuffling operation. When the glasses are shuffled, the marble doesn't travel from one glass to another: it moves together with the glass it was initially been put in.\n\nAfter all shuffling operations Petya shows Vasya that the ball has moved to position t. Vasya's task is to say what minimum number of shuffling operations Petya has performed or determine that Petya has made a mistake and the marble could not have got from position s to position t.\n\nExecution time limit: 2.0 seconds\nMemory limit: 256.0 MB\n\n## Input Format\nThe first line contains three integers: n, s, t (1 ≤ n ≤ 105; 1 ≤ s, t ≤ n) — the number of glasses, the ball's initial and final position.

It is guaranteed that all pi's are distinct.\n\nNote that s can equal t.\n\n## Output Format\nIf the marble can move from position s to position t, then print on a single line a non-negative integer — the minimum number of shuffling operations, needed to get the marble to position t.

Note that it doesn't matter which city we call the start: the trip will be a cycle visiting every city exactly once.\nLet's rewrite the cost of a flight $$$i\\to j$$$ as $$$$$$\\max(c_i, a_j-a_i)=c_i+\\max(0, a_j-a_i-c_i).$$$$$$\nSince we always need to leave each city exactly once, we can ignore the $$$c_i$$$ term from all flights and only try to minimize the sum of $$$\\max(0,a_j-a_i-c_i).$$$\nNote that a flight to a city of smaller beauty is always free in the adjusted cost. So all we need is a path from $$$a_1$$$ to $$$a_n$$$, and the rest of the trip can be done for free. Also, any valid trip will contain a path from $$$a_1$$$ to $$$a_n$$$, so the shortest path is optimal.\nSolution 1\nAll we have to do is encode the graph without storing all edges explicitly, and we can simply run Dijkstra's algorithm to find the shortest path. Add the following edges:\n1. $$$a_i\\to a_{i-1}$$$ with weight $$$0$$$.\n2. $$$i\\to j$$$ with weight $$$0$$$, where $$$j$$$ is the largest index with $$$a_j-a_i-c_i\\le 0$$$. The index $$$j$$$ can be found with binary search.\n3. $$$i\\to j+1$$$ with weight $$$\\max(0, a_{j+1}-a_i-c_i)$$$ where $$$j$$$ is the same as before.\nEvery edge in this new graph corresponds to an edge in the original graph, and every edge in the original graph corresponds to a path in the new graph with at most the same cost. So the distance from $$$a_1$$$ to $$$a_n$$$ is preserved.\nSolution 2\nA simpler solution is to compute for all $$$i>1$$$, the minimum possible cost of the first trip reaching $$$a_i$$$ or larger. It's easy to see that any path must have at least this cost, and we can construct a path of this cost since moving to smaller $$$a_i$$$ is free. It corresponds to the following summation.\n$$$$$$\\sum_{i=2}^n \\max(0, a_i-\\max_{j<i}(a_j+c_j))$$$$$$\nComplexity is $$$O(n\\log n)$$$.\n",

(symbols in symmetric positions are uniquely determined):\n• If $$$s[n-i+1]=$$$'?', then $$$s[n-i+1] = s[i]$$$;\n• If $$$s[i] \\ne s[n-i+1]$$$, then at the end we will not get a palindrome in any way, so the answer is '-1'.\nNote that after such a replacement, the remaining characters '?' are split into pairs, except maybe the central one. If the center character is '?' then it is necessary to put the character '0' if $$$a$$$ is odd, or '1' if $$$b$$$ is odd (if neither $$$a$$$, nor $$$b$$$ is odd, then the answer is '-1').\nNow the remaining characters '?' are split into pairs (i.e. if $$$s[i]=$$$'?', then $$$s[n-i+1]=$$$'?'). This allows the remaining characters '0' and '1' to be replaced greedily:\n• If $$$s[i]=$$$'?' and $$$a>1$$$, then $$$s[i]=s[n-i+1]=$$$'0' and decrease $$$a$$$ for $$$2$$$;\n• If $$$s[i]=$$$'?' and $$$b>1$$$, then $$$s[i]=s[n-i +1]=$$$'1' and decrease $$$b$$$ for $$$2$$$;\n• Otherwise the answer is '-1'.\n",
      "output": "To solve this problem, we need to replace all '?' characters in a given string such that the resulting string is a palindrome and contains exactly `a` '0's and `b` '1's. The solution must efficiently handle large input constraints and ensure the string meets the palindrome requirement while using the exact counts of '0's and '1's.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Initial Checks**: Verify if the given counts of '0's (`a`) and '1's (`b`) are feasible based on the initial counts in the string. If not, output `-1`.\n2. **Process Pairs**: Traverse the string in pairs from the start and end towards the center. Replace '?' with the corresponding character from the symmetric position if one is known. Track the remaining required counts of '0's and '1's.\n3. **Handle Middle Character**: For odd-length strings, check the middle character. If it is '?', set it to '0' or '1' based on the remaining required counts, ensuring parity constraints are met.\n4. **Check Parity**: Ensure the remaining counts of '0's and '1's are even for even-length strings or adjusted correctly for odd-length strings.\n5. **Fill Remaining Pairs**: Replace remaining pairs of '?' with '0's or '1's, prioritizing the character with the higher remaining count while ensuring the counts are exactly met.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nt = int(input())\nfor _ in range(t):\n    a, b = map(int, input().split())\n    s = list(input().strip())\n    n = len(s)\n    count0 = s.count('0')\n    count1 = s.count('1')\n    a_req = a - count0\n    b_req = b - count1\n    \n    if a_req < 0 or b_req < 0:\n        print(-1)\n        continue\n    \n    possible = True\n    \n    # Process pairs\n    for i in range(n // 2):\n        j = n - 1 - i\n        left = s[i]\n        right = s[j]\n        if left == '?' and right == '?':\n            continue\n        if left != '?' and right != '?':\n            if left != right:\n                possible = False\n                break\n        else:\n            # Determine which character to set\n            if left == '?':\n                char = right\n                s[i] = char\n            else:\n                char = left\n                s[j] = char\n            # Update counts\n            if char == '0':\n                a_req -= 1\n                count0 += 1\n            else:\n                b_req -= 1\n                count1 += 1\n            # Check if requirements are still met\n            if a_req < 0 or b_req < 0:\n                possible = False\n                break\n    \n    if not possible:\n        print(-1)\n        continue\n    \n    # Handle middle character for odd length\n    if n % 2 == 1:\n        mid = n // 2\n        if s[mid] == '?':\n            if a_req % 2 == 1:\n                s[mid] = '0'\n                a_req -= 1\n                count0 += 1\n            elif b_req % 2 == 1:\n                s[mid] = '1'\n                b_req -= 1\n                count1 += 1\n            else:\n                possible = False\n            # Check parity after setting middle\n            if a_req % 2 != 0 or b_req % 2 != 0:\n                possible = False\n        # Check if middle character is valid\n        if a_req < 0 or b_req < 0:\n            possible = False\n    else:\n        # Check even parity for even length\n        if a_req % 2 != 0 or b_req % 2 != 0:\n            possible = False\n    \n    if not possible:\n        print(-1)\n        continue\n    \n    # Process remaining pairs\n    for i in range(n // 2):\n        j = n - 1 - i\n        if s[i] == '?' and s[j] == '?':\n            if a_req >= 2:\n                s[i] = s[j] = '0'\n                a_req -= 2\n            elif b_req >= 2:\n                s[i] = s[j] = '1'\n                b_req -= 2\n            else:\n                possible = False\n                break\n            if a_req < 0 or b_req < 0:\n                possible = False\n                break\n    \n    if a_req != 0 or b_req != 0:\n        possible = False\n    \n    if possible:\n        print(''.join(s))\n    else:\n        print(-1)\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Initial Checks**: Verify if the required counts of '0's and '1's are non-negative based on the initial counts in the string.\n2. **Pair Processing**: Ensure symmetric positions in the string either match or are filled in a way that maintains the palindrome property, adjusting the remaining required counts.\n3. **Middle Character Handling**: For odd-length strings, the middle character is handled to ensure the remaining counts are even.\n4. **Parity Check**: Ensure the remaining counts of '0's and '1's are even for even-length strings or adjusted correctly for odd-length strings.\n5. **Filling Remaining Pairs**: Replace remaining '?' pairs with '0's or '1's based on the remaining counts, ensuring the final string meets the exact count requirements and is a palindrome.",

Bulmart, an emerging trade giant, decided to dominate the market of ... shovels! And now almost every city in Berland has a Bulmart store, and some cities even have several of them! The only problem is, at the moment sales are ... let's say a little below estimates. Some people even say that shovels retail market is too small for such a big company to make a profit. But the company management believes in the future of that market and seeks new ways to increase income.\n\nThere are n cities in Berland connected with m bi-directional roads. All roads have equal lengths. It can happen that it is impossible to reach a city from another city using only roads. There is no road which connects a city to itself. Any pair of cities can be connected by at most one road.\n\nThere are w Bulmart stores in Berland. Each of them is described by three numbers:\n\n- ci — the number of city where the i-th store is located (a city can have no stores at all or have several of them),\n- ki — the number of shovels in the i-th store,\n- pi — the price of a single shovel in the i-th store (in burles).\n\nThe latest idea of the Bulmart management is to create a program which will help customers get shovels as fast as possible for affordable budget. Formally, the program has to find the minimum amount of time needed to deliver rj shovels to the customer in the city gj for the total cost of no more than aj burles. The delivery time between any two adjacent cities is equal to 1. If shovels are delivered from several cities, the delivery time is equal to the arrival time of the last package. The delivery itself is free of charge.\n\nThe program needs to find answers to q such queries. Each query has to be processed independently from others, i.e. a query does not change number of shovels in stores for the next queries.\n\n## Constraints\nTime limit per test: 1.5 seconds\nMemory limit per test: 512.0 megabytes\n\n## Input Format\nThe first line contains two integers n, m (1 ≤ n ≤ 5000, 0 ≤ m ≤ min(5000, n·(n - 1) / 2)). Each of the next m lines contains two integers xe and ye, meaning that the e-th road connects cities xe and ye (1 ≤ xe, ye ≤ n).\n\nThe next line contains a single integer w (1 ≤ w ≤ 5000) — the total number of Bulmart stores in Berland. Each of the next w lines contains three integers describing the i-th store: ci, ki, pi (1 ≤ ci ≤ n, 1 ≤ ki, pi ≤ 2·105).\n\nThe next line contains a single integer q (1 ≤ q ≤ 1000) — the number of queries. Each of the next q lines contains three integers describing the j-th query: gj, rj and aj (1 ≤ gj ≤ n, 1 ≤ rj, aj ≤ 109)\n\n## Output Format\nOutput q lines. On the j-th line, print an answer for the j-th query — the minimum amount of time needed to deliver rj shovels to the customer in city gj spending no more than aj burles. Print -1 if there is no solution for the j-th query.\n\n## Examples\n```input\n6 4\n4 2\n5 4\n1 2\n3 2\n2\n4 1 2\n3 2 3\n6\n1 2 6\n2 3 7\n3 1 2\n4 3 8\n5 2 5\n6 1 10\n```\n```output\n2\n-1\n2\n2\n3\n-1\n```\n\n## Editorial\nLet's sort all stores in increasing order of cost of one shovel and we need to process queries separately one by one.\nLet for the current query the number city to deliver is g, the number of shovels to deliver is r and the cost must be no more than a. At first with help of bfs find the distance from the city g to the other cities. Then we need to make binary search on the maximum distance from the city g to the cities from which the shovels will be deliver for the current query.\nIn the objective function of the binary search we need to iterate through the stores in the sorted order of their cost and if the distance to the current store is no more than permitted we need to deliver from this city as many shovels as we can and as we need.\nIf for the current permitted distance we can deliver r shovels and it price no more than a move to the middle the right end of the binary search. In the other case move to the middle the left end of the binary search.\nDo not forget clear the array with distances before process each query.\n",

It's boring for them to play usual tic-tac-toe game, so they are a playing modified version of this game. Here are its rules.\n\nThe game is played on the following field.\n\nPlayers are making moves by turns. At first move a player can put his chip in any cell of any small field. For following moves, there are some restrictions: if during last move the opposite player put his chip to cell with coordinates (xl, yl) in some small field, the next move should be done in one of the cells of the small field with coordinates (xl, yl). For example, if in the first move a player puts his chip to lower left cell of central field, then the second player on his next move should put his chip into some cell of lower left field (pay attention to the first test case). If there are no free cells in the required field, the player can put his chip to any empty cell on any field.\n\nYou are given current state of the game and coordinates of cell in which the last move was done. You should find all cells in which the current player can put his chip.\n\nA hare works as a postman in the forest, he likes to foul bears. Sometimes he changes the game field a bit, so the current state of the game could be unreachable. However, after his changes the cell where the last move was done is not empty. You don't need to find if the state is unreachable or not, just output possible next moves according to the rules.\n\n## Constraints\nTime limit per test: 2.0 seconds\nMemory limit per test: 256.0 megabytes\n\n## Input Format\nFirst 11 lines contains descriptions of table with 9 rows and 9 columns which are divided into 9 small fields by spaces and empty lines. Each small field is described by 9 characters without spaces and empty lines. character \"x\" (ASCII-code 120) means that the cell is occupied with chip of the first player, character \"o\" (ASCII-code 111) denotes a field occupied with chip of the second player, character \".\" (ASCII-code 46) describes empty cell.\n\nThe line after the table contains two integers x and y (1 ≤ x, y ≤ 9). They describe coordinates of the cell in table where the last move was done. Rows in the table are numbered from up to down and columns are numbered from left to right.\n\nIt's guaranteed that cell where the last move was done is filled with \"x\" or \"o\". Also, it's guaranteed that there is at least one empty cell. It's not guaranteed that current state of game is reachable.\n\n## Output Format\nOutput the field in same format with characters \"!\" (ASCII-code 33) on positions where the current player can put his chip. All other cells should not be modified.\n\n## Examples\n```input\n... ... ...\n... ... ...\n... ... ...\n... ... ...\n... ... ...\n... x.. ...\n... ... ...\n... ... ...\n... ... ...\n6 4\n```\n```output\n... ... ...\n... ... ...\n... ... ...\n... ... ...\n... ... ...\n... x.. ...\n!!! ... ...\n!!! ... ...\n!!! ... ...\n```\n-----\n```input\nxoo x.. x..\nooo ... ...\nooo ... ...\nx.. x.. x..\n... ... ...\n... ... ...\nx.. x.. x..\n... ... ...\n... ... ...\n7 4\n```\n```output\nxoo x!! x!!\nooo !!! !!!\nooo !!! !!!\nx!! x!! x!!\n!!! !!! !!!\n!!! !!! !!!\nx!! x!! x!!\n!!! !!! !!!\n!!! !!! !!!\n```\n-----\n```input\no.. ... ...\n... ... ...\n... ... ...\n... xxx ...\n... xox ...\n... ooo ...\n... ... ...\n... ... ...\n... ... ...\n5 5\n```\n```output\no!! !!! !!!\n!!! !!! !!!\n!!! !!! !!!\n!!! xxx !!!\n!!! xox !!!\n!!! ooo !!!\n!!! !!! !!!\n!!! !!! !!!\n!!! !!! !!!\n```\n\n## Note\nIn the first test case the first player made a move to lower left cell of central field, so the second player can put a chip only to cells of lower left field.\n\nIn the second test case the last move was done to upper left cell of lower central field, however all cells in upper left field are occupied, so the second player can put his chip to any empty cell.\n\nIn the third test case the last move was done to central cell of central field, so current player can put his chip to any cell of central field, which is already occupied, so he can move anywhere. Pay attention that this state of the game is unreachable.\n\n## Editorial\nLet us describe each cell of the field by four numbers (xb, yb, xs, ys), 0 ≤ xb, yb, xs, ys ≤ 2), where (xb, yb) are coordinates of small field containing the cell, and (xs, ys) are coordinates of the cell in it's small field. It can be seen that for cell with \"usual\" coordinates (x, y), 1 ≤ x, y ≤ 9 and our new (xb, yb, xs, ys), there are following equalities which give us a key to go between coordinate systems:\n• xb = ⌊((x - 1) / 3)⌋, yb = ⌊((y - 1) / 3)⌋;\n• xs = (x - 1) mod 3, yb = (y - 1) mod 3;\n• x = 3 * xb + xs + 1, y = 3 * yb + ys + 1.\nIn terms of new coordinates, if last move was in cell (xb, yb, xs, ys), then next move should be in arbitrary free cell with coordinates (xs, ys, x', y') for some $$x', y' \\in [0, 2]$$ if it's possible; otherwise, next move can be done in arbitrary free cell. To solve the problem, one can go through all such pairs (x', y') and write \"!\" in each empty cell (xs, ys, x', y'); if there are not such empty cells, write \"!\" in all empty cells of the field.\n",

The coursework consists of $$$m$$$ pages.\n\nPolycarp also has $$$n$$$ cups of coffee. The coffee in the $$$i$$$-th cup has $$$a_i$$$ caffeine in it. Polycarp can drink some cups of coffee (each one no more than once). He can drink cups in any order. Polycarp drinks each cup instantly and completely (i.e. he cannot split any cup into several days).\n\nSurely, courseworks are not usually being written in a single day (in a perfect world of Berland, at least). Some of them require multiple days of hard work.\n\nLet's consider some day of Polycarp's work. Consider Polycarp drinks $$$k$$$ cups of coffee during this day and caffeine dosages of cups Polycarp drink during this day are $$$a_{i_1}, a_{i_2}, \\dots, a_{i_k}$$$. Then the first cup he drinks gives him energy to write $$$a_{i_1}$$$ pages of coursework, the second cup gives him energy to write $$$max(0, a_{i_2} - 1)$$$ pages, the third cup gives him energy to write $$$max(0, a_{i_3} - 2)$$$ pages, ..., the $$$k$$$-th cup gives him energy to write $$$max(0, a_{i_k} - k + 1)$$$ pages.\n\nIf Polycarp doesn't drink coffee during some day, he cannot write coursework at all that day.\n\nPolycarp has to finish his coursework as soon as possible (spend the minimum number of days to do it). Your task is to find out this number of days or say that it is impossible.\n\n## Constraints\nTime limit per test: 1.0 seconds\nMemory limit per test: 256.0 megabytes\n\n## Input Format\nThe first line of the input contains two integers $$$n$$$ and $$$m$$$ ($$$1 \\le n \\le 100$$$, $$$1 \\le m \\le 10^4$$$) — the number of cups of coffee and the number of pages in the coursework.\n\nThe second line of the input contains $$$n$$$ integers $$$a_1, a_2, \\dots, a_n$$$ ($$$1 \\le a_i \\le 100$$$), where $$$a_i$$$ is the caffeine dosage of coffee in the $$$i$$$-th cup.\n\n## Output Format\nIf it is impossible to write the coursework, print -1. Otherwise print the minimum number of days Polycarp needs to do it.\n\n## Examples\n```input\n5 8\n2 3 1 1 2\n```\n```output\n4\n```\n-----\n```input\n7 10\n1 3 4 2 1 4 2\n```\n```output\n2\n```\n-----\n```input\n5 15\n5 5 5 5 5\n```\n```output\n1\n```\n-----\n```input\n5 16\n5 5 5 5 5\n```\n```output\n2\n```\n-----\n```input\n5 26\n5 5 5 5 5\n```\n```output\n-1\n```\n\n## Note\nIn the first example Polycarp can drink fourth cup during first day (and write $$$1$$$ page), first and second cups during second day (and write $$$2 + (3 - 1) = 4$$$ pages), fifth cup during the third day (and write $$$2$$$ pages) and third cup during the fourth day (and write $$$1$$$ page) so the answer is $$$4$$$. It is obvious that there is no way to write the coursework in three or less days in this test.\n\nIn the second example Polycarp can drink third, fourth and second cups during first day (and write $$$4 + (2 - 1) + (3 - 2) = 6$$$ pages) and sixth cup during second day (and write $$$4$$$ pages) so the answer is $$$2$$$. It is obvious that Polycarp cannot write the whole coursework in one day in this test.\n\nIn the third example Polycarp can drink all cups of coffee during first day and write $$$5 + (5 - 1) + (5 - 2) + (5 - 3) + (5 - 4) = 15$$$ pages of coursework.\n\nIn the fourth example Polycarp cannot drink all cups during first day and should drink one of them during the second day. So during first day he will write $$$5 + (5 - 1) + (5 - 2) + (5 - 3) = 14$$$ pages of coursework and during second day he will write $$$5$$$ pages of coursework. This is enough to complete it.\n\nIn the fifth example Polycarp cannot write the whole coursework at all, even if he will drink one cup of coffee during each day, so the answer is -1.\n",

The game has $$$n$$$ weapons: the $$$i$$$-th gun has an integer fire rate $$$f_i$$$ and an integer damage per bullet $$$d_i$$$. The $$$i$$$-th gun's total firepower is equal to $$$p_i = f_i \\cdot d_i$$$.\n\nYou have to modify the values $$$d_i$$$ of some guns in such a way that the new values $$$d_i$$$ will still be integers, and the firepower of all guns will become balanced. Given an integer $$$k$$$, the guns are said to be balanced if $$$\\max\\limits_{1 \\le i \\le n}{p_i} - \\min\\limits_{1 \\le i \\le n}{p_i} \\le k$$$.\n\nSince gamers that play your game don't like big changes, you need to change the values $$$d_i$$$ for the minimum possible number of guns. What is the minimum number of guns for which you have to change these values to make the guns balanced?\n\nNote that the new values $$$d_i$$$ must be integers greater than $$$0$$$.\n\n## Constraints\nTime limit per test: 3.0 seconds\nMemory limit per test: 256.0 megabytes\n\n## Input Format\nThe first line contains a single integer $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \\le t \\le 1000$$$) — the number of test cases.\n\nThe first line of each test case contains two integers $$$n$$$ and $$$k$$$ ($$$2 \\le n \\le 3000$$$; $$$0 \\le k \\le 1500$$$) — the number of guns to balance, and the maximum allowed gap between the most and the least powerful weapons.\n\nThe second line contains $$$n$$$ integers $$$f_1, f_2, \\dots, f_n$$$ ($$$1 \\le f_i \\le 2000$$$), where $$$f_i$$$ is the fire rate of the $$$i$$$-th gun.\n\nThe third line contains $$$n$$$ integers $$$d_1, d_2, \\dots, d_n$$$ ($$$1 \\le d_i \\le 10^9$$$), where $$$d_i$$$ is the damage per bullet of the $$$i$$$-th gun.\n\nIt's guaranteed that the sum of $$$n$$$ over all test cases doesn't exceed $$$3000$$$.\n\n## Output Format\nFor each test case, print the minimum number of guns which damage $$$d_i$$$ you have to change in order to make the guns balanced.\n\nNote that the new values $$$d_i$$$ must be integers greater than $$$0$$$.\n\n## Examples\n```input\n5\n4 2\n6 3 13 7\n1 2 1 2\n3 2\n100 101 102\n100 99 98\n5 0\n1 12 4 4 3\n12 1 3 3 4\n2 50\n1000 10\n1000000000 1\n3 5\n1 19 11\n49 4 72\n```\n```output\n2\n3\n0\n1\n2\n```\n\n## Note\nIn the first test case, you can set $$$d_1 = 2$$$ and $$$d_2 = 4$$$. You'll get an array $$$d = [2, 4, 1, 2]$$$, and the values of firepower will be $$$p = [12, 12, 13, 14]$$$. The guns are balanced, since $$$14 - 12 \\le 2$$$.\n\nIn the second test case, you have to change the value $$$d_i$$$ for all three guns. For example, you can set $$$d = [5151, 5100, 5050]$$$.\n\nIn the third test case, all guns are already balanced, so you don't have to change anything.\n\n## Editorial\nNote that the answer $$$n$$$ is always possible: for example, we can set $$$d_i = \\frac{\\prod{f_j}}{f_i}$$$, then $$$p_1 = \\dots = p_n = \\prod{f_j}$$$ and $$$\\max{p_i} - \\min{p_i} = 0$$$.\nIf the answer is less than $$$n$$$ then there is at least one gun $$$id$$$ we won't change. It means that all other guns' firepower should be \"around\" $$$p_{id}$$$, i. e. $$$|p_i - p_{id}| \\le k$$$. So we can look at segment $$$[p_{id} - k, p_{id} + k]$$$ and, for each gun $$$i$$$, find what values $$$d'_i$$$ we should set to get into this segment. After that we can rephrase our task into the next one: we should choose segment $$$[l, l + k] \\subset [p_{id} - k, p_{id} + k]$$$ such that each gun occurs in $$$[l, l + k]$$$ at least once and the number of corresponding $$$d'_i$$$ that are equal to $$$d_i$$$ is maximum possible.\nIt can be solved with two pointers technique. Note that there are at most three interesting values $$$d'_i$$$ we should consider: $$$v_1 = \\left\\lfloor \\frac{p_{id}}{f_i} \\right\\rfloor$$$, $$$v_2 = v_1 + 1$$$ and $$$v_3 = d_i$$$. For each unique value $$$v_j$$$ such that $$$v_j \\cdot f_i \\in [p_{id} - k, p_{id} + k]$$$ we can add an event $$$(i, c_j)$$$ in position $$$v_j f_i$$$, where $$$c_j$$$ is $$$1$$$ if $$$v_j = d_i$$$ or $$$0$$$ otherwise.\nNow, with two pointers technique, we can iterate over all subsegments of length $$$k + 1$$$ of segment $$$[p_{id} - k, p_{id} + k]$$$. To get the desired answer we should maintain the number of unique $$$i$$$ from events that are present in the subsegment and the sum $$$s$$$ of $$$c_j$$$ from that events. Since there is only one $$$c_j = 1$$$ for each gun $$$i$$$ then the sum $$$s$$$ of $$$c_j$$$ we have is equal exactly to the number of guns we shouldn't change. Then we take the maximum $$$mx$$$ over sums $$$s$$$ of all subsegments where all guns occur, and the answer for a fixed $$$p_{id}$$$ is $$$n - mx$$$.\nLet's iterate over all \"fixed\" $$$id$$$ and take the minimum from all $$$n - mx$$$: that will be the answer for the initial task.\nChecking answer for a fixed $$$id$$$ involves creating $$$3 n$$$ events and two pointers over segment $$$[p_{id} - k, p_{id} + k]$$$, so it takes $$$O(n + k)$$$ time and $$$O(n + k)$$$ space. So, the total complexity is $$$O(n^2 + n k)$$$ time and $$$O(n + k)$$$ space.\n",

Seedlings of this plant need sun to grow up. Slastyona has m seedlings, and the j-th seedling needs at least kj minutes of sunlight to grow up.\n\nMost of the time it's sunny in Sweetland, but sometimes some caramel clouds come, the i-th of which will appear at time moment (minute) li and disappear at time moment ri. Of course, the clouds make shadows, and the seedlings can't grow when there is at least one cloud veiling the sun.\n\nSlastyona wants to grow up her muffins as fast as possible. She has exactly C candies, which is the main currency in Sweetland.\n\nOne can dispel any cloud by paying ci candies. However, in order to comply with Sweetland's Department of Meteorology regulations, one can't dispel more than two clouds.\n\nSlastyona hasn't decided yet which of the m seedlings will be planted at the princess' garden, so she needs your help. For each seedling determine the earliest moment it can grow up if Slastyona won't break the law and won't spend more candies than she has. Note that each of the seedlings is considered independently.\n\nThe seedlings start to grow at time moment 0.\n\n## Constraints\nTime limit per test: 3.0 seconds\nMemory limit per test: 256.0 megabytes\n\n## Input Format\nThe first line contains two integers n and C (0 ≤ n ≤ 3·105, 0 ≤ C ≤ 109) – the number of caramel clouds and the number of candies Slastyona has.\n\nThe next n lines contain three integers each: li, ri, ci (0 ≤ li < ri ≤ 109, 0 ≤ ci ≤ 109), describing one caramel cloud.\n\nThe next line contains single integer m (1 ≤ m ≤ 3·105) – the number of seedlings. Each of the seedlings is described with one integer kj (1 ≤ kj ≤ 109) – the required number of sunny minutes.\n\n## Output Format\nFor each seedling print one integer – the minimum minute Slastyona can grow it up.\n\n## Examples\n```input\n3 5\n1 7 1\n1 6 2\n1 7 1\n3\n7\n2\n5\n```\n```output\n12\n7\n10\n```\n-----\n```input\n3 15\n1 4 17\n2 8 6\n4 8 9\n2\n5\n1\n```\n```output\n8\n1\n```\n-----\n```input\n2 10\n3 7 9\n10 90 10\n2\n10\n100\n```\n```output\n10\n104\n```\n\n## Note\nConsider the first example. For each k it is optimal to dispel clouds 1 and 3. Then the remaining cloud will give shadow on time segment [1..6]. So, intervals [0..1] and [6..inf) are sunny.\n\nIn the second example for k = 1 it is not necessary to dispel anything, and for k = 5 the best strategy is to dispel clouds 2 and 3. This adds an additional sunny segment [4..8], which together with [0..1] allows to grow up the muffin at the eight minute.\n\nIf the third example the two seedlings are completely different. For the first one it is necessary to dispel cloud 1 and obtain a sunny segment [0..10]. However, the same strategy gives answer 180 for the second seedling. Instead, we can dispel cloud 2, to make segments [0..3] and [7..inf) sunny, and this allows up to shorten the time to 104.\n\n## Editorial\nPrequisites: scanline.\nThe key idea is that only minutes which are covered by no more than two clouds can contribute to the answer.\nLet us demonstrate how to solve the problem for a fixed k using scanline. Let's create 2·n events: for the start and the end of each cloud. We will then go through all the events in ascending order of their coordinates, maintaining the following values:\n• the set of active clouds open;\n• the count of sunny (from the beginning!) minutes free;\n• the array single(i), which denotes the number of minutes covered solely by cloud i;\n• the variable top – the largest number of sunny minutes we can obtain on a given prefix by deleting no more than two clouds;\n• the sparse table cross, whose element (a, b) holds the number of minutes of sunny minutes covered solely by a and b;\n• and finally, the array opt(i) – the optimal number of sunny minutes we can obtain if we dispel i-th cloud as one of the selected ones.\nWe will also construct a treap (or BIT/segment tree if we want to), where each leaf has the index in form of the pair cost(i), i, keeping best index relative to single(i) in the subtree in each node.\nSo, let us assume we are now considering some event with the coordinate x, which is going to add some segment with length len.\n• If open is empty, it's enough to just increase free by len.\n• If open contains exactly two elements (let's denote them as a and b), we need to increase cross[a, b] by len and try to update opt(a) via using b and opt(b) via using a if it's possible (i.e. if the sum of costs does not exceed the budget).\n• The case when open only one element is the most interesting. We have to try to increase both single(a) and opt(a) by len consequently. What clouds may optima have also updated for? Obviously, for every cloud which cost allows us to dispel it together the cloud a. But it's only necessary to update opt only for cloud with maximal single(x) (don't forget to delete a from the tree) on range [0..C - cost(a)]. Why? We leave this as an excercise for the reader.\nAfter that, we will either need to remove the start of the cloud from open if we are dealing with a closing event, or to put it into open otherwise.\nAlong with aforementioned operations we can also update the variable top. It's not that hard to observe that if free + top ≥ k, the answer would be some point of the last segment: we can find it as x - (free + top) - k.\nIt's also worth noting that if we are to order all the queries in the non-descending order, the answers would be ordered the same way. We can then process them in one go.\nTime complexity: $${ \\mathcal { O } } ( n \\log(n) + m \\log(m) )$$.\n",
      "output": "To solve this problem, we need to determine the earliest moment each seedling can grow up given the constraints on sunlight and caramel clouds.

If we have $$x \\equiv 0 (\\bmod 2)$$, then the string s must look like 0?0?0?..., that is, all even positions 0, 2, 4, ... will have 0's (for all others, we can't say), and if $$x \\equiv 1 (\\bmod 2)$$, then s looks like ?0?0?0.... Similarly, knowing the remainder of x modulo a prime p in factorization of N implies that there are zeros in s with p positions apart. If we fix all remainder modulo p1, ..., pn, then the string will be determined unambigiously. Notice that after fixing the modulos, there are still N' = p1α1 - 1... pnαn - 1 possible x's between 0 and N - 1; we will simply multiply the answer by N' in the end.\nAt this point we have a brute-force solution: try all values for remainders, count how many of the values give the string s. This is of course too slow, but we can make a few optimizations:\n• Make a brute-force into a DP by introducing memoization. We will count the number of ways to obtain each partial string s after fixing first i remainders. Of course, we don't have to store all 2m masks, but just the reachable ones.\n• Once pi > m, each choice of remainder either places a single zero into a string, or doesn't change anything. At this point we are not interested in the full mask, but rather in the number of \"unsatisfied\" zeros of initial string s. Each transition either satisfies one zero, or doesn't change anything; the number of transitions of each kind is easy to count.\nWe will do a full memoization DP for pi ≤ m, and continue with a compressed DP once pi > m. The second part can be done in O(nm) time and O(m) memory. The complexity of the first part depends on the total number of states in the memoization DP.\nTurns out this number can be much larger than we anticipated on certain tests, for instance, primes starting from 5 or 7. On these cases, all our model solutions received time out. Such tests didn't appear in the original test set, of course.\n[user:KAN] and myself tried to improve the solution. The idea behind our optimization is that once pi > m / 2, several central bits of the mask behave just like the \"unsatisfied\" bits in the large-prime part of the original solution: if we choose to cover them, it will be the single bit we cover. Thus we can do a \"hybrid\" DP that has parameters (number of unsatisfied bits in the middle, mask of all the rest bits).\n[user:KAN]'s solution used \"naive\" mask DP for pi ≤ 23, switched to static array for pi = 29, 31, 37, and then proceeded to large primes as before. I tried to write a self-adaptive solution that handles all ranges of primes pretty much the same way. [user:KAN] was more successful: his solution works in $$\\sim 3.5$$ seconds on all cases we could counstruct; my solution works in $$\\sim 11$$ seconds and uses a lot of excess memory.\n[user:KAN]'s solution: [submission:24707930], my solution: [submission:24707929].\n",

Initially, Farmer John has n different species of flowers he can plant, with ai flowers of the i-th species.\n\nOn each of the next q days, Farmer John will receive a batch of flowers of a new species. On day j, he will receive cj flowers of the same species, but of a different species from those Farmer John already has.\n\nFarmer John, knowing the right balance between extravagance and minimalism, wants exactly k species of flowers to be used. Furthermore, to reduce waste, each flower of the k species Farmer John chooses must be planted in some garden. And each of the gardens must be identical; that is to say that each of the k chosen species should have an equal number of flowers in each garden. As Farmer John is a proponent of national equality, he would like to create the greatest number of gardens possible.\n\nAfter receiving flowers on each of these q days, Farmer John would like to know the sum, over all possible choices of k species, of the maximum number of gardens he could create.

Choosing (4, 6, 9), (4, 9, 8) and (6, 9, 8) each only let him make one garden, since there is no number of gardens that each species can be evenly split into. So the sum over all choices of k = 3 flowers is 2 + 1 + 1 + 1 = 5.\n\nAfter the second day, Farmer John has (4, 6, 9, 8, 6) of each flower. The sum over all choices is 1 + 2 + 2 + 1 + 1 + 2 + 2 + 3 + 1 + 1 = 16.\n\nIn the second sample case, k = 1. With x flowers Farmer John can make x gardens.

To do this, you need to pick one of the available preprocessing methods and return a tuple of its index and its parameters. The parameters of all methods are Double[].\n\n- Method 1: padding. The resulting data is a concatenation of the parameters and the features.\n- Method 2: tensor product. The resulting data is an array of pairwise products of the elements of the parameters and the features.\n- Method 3: fanout. The resulting data is a tensor product of the parameters, the features and the features (so that you have access to all pairwise products of features).\n- Method 4: split fanout. The resulting data is tensor product of (concatenation of the left halves of parameters and features) and (concatenation of the right halves).\n- Default method: no preprocessing. The features remain unchanged, the parameters are ignored. This method is used when any index other than 1-4 is returned.\n\nAfter the preprocessing step the resulting data is encoded in the quantum state using amplitudes encoding: element $$$j$$$ of the data is encoded in the amplitude of basis state $$$|j\\rangle$$$.

Xenia is currently studying bit operations. To better understand how they work, Xenia decided to calculate some value v for a.\n\nNamely, it takes several iterations to calculate value v. At the first iteration, Xenia writes a new sequence a1 or a2, a3 or a4, ..., a2n - 1 or a2n, consisting of 2n - 1 elements. In other words, she writes down the bit-wise OR of adjacent elements of sequence a. At the second iteration, Xenia writes the bitwise exclusive OR of adjacent elements of the sequence obtained after the first iteration. At the third iteration Xenia writes the bitwise OR of the adjacent elements of the sequence obtained after the second iteration. And so on; the operations of bitwise exclusive OR and bitwise OR alternate. In the end, she obtains a sequence consisting of one element, and that element is v.\n\nLet's consider an example. Suppose that sequence a = (1, 2, 3, 4). Then let's write down all the transformations (1, 2, 3, 4)  →  (1 or 2 = 3, 3 or 4 = 7)  →  (3 xor 7 = 4). The result is v = 4.\n\nYou are given Xenia's initial sequence. But to calculate value v for a given sequence would be too easy, so you are given additional m queries. Each query is a pair of integers p, b. Query p, b means that you need to perform the assignment ap = b. After each query, you need to print the new value v for the new sequence a.\n\n## Constraints\nTime limit per test: 2.0 seconds\nMemory limit per test: 256.0 megabytes\n\n## Input Format\nThe first line contains two integers n and m (1 ≤ n ≤ 17, 1 ≤ m ≤ 105). The next line contains 2n integers a1, a2, ..., a2n (0 ≤ ai < 230). Each of the next m lines contains queries. The i-th line contains integers pi, bi (1 ≤ pi ≤ 2n, 0 ≤ bi < 230) — the i-th query.\n\n## Output Format\nPrint m integers — the i-th integer denotes value v for sequence a after the i-th query.\n\n## Examples\n```input\n2 4\n1 6 3 5\n1 4\n3 4\n1 2\n1 2\n```\n```output\n1\n3\n3\n3\n```\n\n## Note\nFor more information on the bit operations, you can follow this link: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bitwise_operation\n",

Being a modern web service it includes login feature. And that always implies password security problems.\n\nPolycarp decided to store the hash of the password, generated by the following algorithm:\n\n1. take the password $$$p$$$, consisting of lowercase Latin letters, and shuffle the letters randomly in it to obtain $$$p'$$$ ($$$p'$$$ can still be equal to $$$p$$$);\n2. generate two random strings, consisting of lowercase Latin letters, $$$s_1$$$ and $$$s_2$$$ (any of these strings can be empty);\n3. the resulting hash $$$h = s_1 + p' + s_2$$$, where addition is string concatenation.\n\nFor example, let the password $$$p =$$$ \"abacaba\". Then $$$p'$$$ can be equal to \"aabcaab\". Random strings $$$s1 =$$$ \"zyx\" and $$$s2 =$$$ \"kjh\". Then $$$h =$$$ \"zyxaabcaabkjh\".\n\nNote that no letters could be deleted or added to $$$p$$$ to obtain $$$p'$$$, only the order could be changed.\n\nNow Polycarp asks you to help him to implement the password check module. Given the password $$$p$$$ and the hash $$$h$$$, check that $$$h$$$ can be the hash for the password $$$p$$$.\n\nYour program should answer $$$t$$$ independent test cases.\n\n## Constraints\nTime limit per test: 2.0 seconds\nMemory limit per test: 256.0 megabytes\n\n## Input Format\nThe first line contains one integer $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \\le t \\le 100$$$) — the number of test cases.\n\nThe first line of each test case contains a non-empty string $$$p$$$, consisting of lowercase Latin letters. The length of $$$p$$$ does not exceed $$$100$$$.\n\nThe second line of each test case contains a non-empty string $$$h$$$, consisting of lowercase Latin letters. The length of $$$h$$$ does not exceed $$$100$$$.\n\n## Output Format\nFor each test case print the answer to it — \"YES\" if the given hash $$$h$$$ could be obtained from the given password $$$p$$$ or \"NO\" otherwise.\n\n## Examples\n```input\n5\nabacaba\nzyxaabcaabkjh\nonetwothree\nthreetwoone\none\nzzonneyy\none\nnone\ntwenty\nten\n```\n```output\nYES\nYES\nNO\nYES\nNO\n```\n\n## Note\nThe first test case is explained in the statement.\n\nIn the second test case both $$$s_1$$$ and $$$s_2$$$ are empty and $$$p'=$$$ \"threetwoone\" is $$$p$$$ shuffled.\n\nIn the third test case the hash could not be obtained from the password.\n\nIn the fourth test case $$$s_1=$$$ \"n\", $$$s_2$$$ is empty and $$$p'=$$$ \"one\" is $$$p$$$ shuffled (even thought it stayed the same).\n\nIn the fifth test case the hash could not be obtained from the password.\n\n## Editorial\nThe general idea of the solution is to check that string $$$h$$$ contains some substring which is a permutation of $$$p$$$. The constraints were so low you could do it with any algorithm, even $$$O(n^3 \\log n)$$$ per test case could pass.\nThe most straightforward way was to iterate over the substring of $$$h$$$, sort it and check if it's equal to $$$p$$$ sorted. That's $$$O(n^3 \\log n)$$$.\nNext you could notice than only substrings of length $$$|p|$$$ matter and shave another $$$n$$$ off the complexity to get $$$O(n^2 \\log n)$$$.\nAfter that you might remember that the size of the alphabet is pretty low. And one string is a permutation of another one if the amounts of letters 'a', letters 'b' and so on in them are equal. So you can precalculate array $$$cnt_p$$$, where $$$cnt_p[i]$$$ is equal to the amount of the $$$i$$$-th letter of the alphabet in $$$p$$$. Calculating this array for $$$O(n)$$$ substrings will be $$$O(n)$$$ each, so that makes it $$$O(n^2)$$$.\nThen notice how easy it is to recalculate the letter counts going from some substring $$$[i; i + |p| - 1]$$$ to $$$[i + 1; i + |p|]$$$. Just subtract $$$1$$$ from the amount of the $$$i$$$-th letter and add $$$1$$$ to the amount of the $$$(i + |p|)$$$-th letter. Comparing two array every time will still lead to $$$O(n \\cdot |AL|)$$$, though.\nThe final optimization is to maintain the boolean array $$$eq$$$ such that $$$eq_i$$$ means that $$$cnt_p[i]$$$ is equal to the current value of $$$cnt$$$ of the substring. You are updating just two values of $$$cnt$$$ on each step, thus only two values of $$$eq$$$ might change. You want all the $$$|AL|$$$ values to be $$$true$$$, so keep the number of values $$$true$$$ in that array and say \"YES\" if that number is equal to $$$|AL|$$$. That finally makes the solution $$$O(n)$$$ per test case.\n",

The first officer is the commander of the army, and he does not have any superiors. Every other officer has exactly one direct superior. If officer $$$a$$$ is the direct superior of officer $$$b$$$, then we also can say that officer $$$b$$$ is a direct subordinate of officer $$$a$$$.\n\nOfficer $$$x$$$ is considered to be a subordinate (direct or indirect) of officer $$$y$$$ if one of the following conditions holds:\n\n- officer $$$y$$$ is the direct superior of officer $$$x$$$;\n- the direct superior of officer $$$x$$$ is a subordinate of officer $$$y$$$.\n\nFor example, on the picture below the subordinates of the officer $$$3$$$ are: $$$5, 6, 7, 8, 9$$$.\n\nThe structure of Berland army is organized in such a way that every officer, except for the commander, is a subordinate of the commander of the army.\n\nFormally, let's represent Berland army as a tree consisting of $$$n$$$ vertices, in which vertex $$$u$$$ corresponds to officer $$$u$$$. The parent of vertex $$$u$$$ corresponds to the direct superior of officer $$$u$$$. The root (which has index $$$1$$$) corresponds to the commander of the army.\n\nBerland War Ministry has ordered you to give answers on $$$q$$$ queries, the $$$i$$$-th query is given as $$$(u_i, k_i)$$$, where $$$u_i$$$ is some officer, and $$$k_i$$$ is a positive integer.\n\nTo process the $$$i$$$-th query imagine how a command from $$$u_i$$$ spreads to the subordinates of $$$u_i$$$. Typical DFS (depth first search) algorithm is used here.\n\nSuppose the current officer is $$$a$$$ and he spreads a command. Officer $$$a$$$ chooses $$$b$$$ — one of his direct subordinates (i.e. a child in the tree) who has not received this command yet. If there are many such direct subordinates, then $$$a$$$ chooses the one having minimal index. Officer $$$a$$$ gives a command to officer $$$b$$$. Afterwards, $$$b$$$ uses exactly the same algorithm to spread the command to its subtree. After $$$b$$$ finishes spreading the command, officer $$$a$$$ chooses the next direct subordinate again (using the same strategy). When officer $$$a$$$ cannot choose any direct subordinate who still hasn't received this command, officer $$$a$$$ finishes spreading the command.\n\nLet's look at the following example:\n\nIf officer $$$1$$$ spreads a command, officers receive it in the following order: $$$[1, 2, 3, 5 ,6, 8, 7, 9, 4]$$$.\n\nIf officer $$$3$$$ spreads a command, officers receive it in the following order: $$$[3, 5, 6, 8, 7, 9]$$$.\n\nIf officer $$$7$$$ spreads a command, officers receive it in the following order: $$$[7, 9]$$$.\n\nIf officer $$$9$$$ spreads a command, officers receive it in the following order: $$$[9]$$$.\n\nTo answer the $$$i$$$-th query $$$(u_i, k_i)$$$, construct a sequence which describes the order in which officers will receive the command if the $$$u_i$$$-th officer spreads it. Return the $$$k_i$$$-th element of the constructed list or -1 if there are fewer than $$$k_i$$$ elements in it.\n\nYou should process queries independently. A query doesn't affect the following queries.\n\n## Constraints\nTime limit per test: 3.0 seconds\nMemory limit per test: 256.0 megabytes\n\n## Input Format\nThe first line of the input contains two integers $$$n$$$ and $$$q$$$ ($$$2 \\le n \\le 2 \\cdot 10^5, 1 \\le q \\le 2 \\cdot 10^5$$$) — the number of officers in Berland army and the number of queries.\n\nThe second line of the input contains $$$n - 1$$$ integers $$$p_2, p_3, \\dots, p_n$$$ ($$$1 \\le p_i < i$$$), where $$$p_i$$$ is the index of the direct superior of the officer having the index $$$i$$$. The commander has index $$$1$$$ and doesn't have any superiors.\n\nThe next $$$q$$$ lines describe the queries. The $$$i$$$-th query is given as a pair ($$$u_i, k_i$$$) ($$$1 \\le u_i, k_i \\le n$$$), where $$$u_i$$$ is the index of the officer which starts spreading a command, and $$$k_i$$$ is the index of the required officer in the command spreading sequence.\n\n## Output Format\nPrint $$$q$$$ numbers, where the $$$i$$$-th number is the officer at the position $$$k_i$$$ in the list which describes the order in which officers will receive the command if it starts spreading from officer $$$u_i$$$. Print \"-1\" if the number of officers which receive the command is less than $$$k_i$$$.\n\nYou should process queries independently.

In order to overcome their competitor, \"Poca Pola\" started a super secret project, for which it has total $$$n$$$ vacancies in all of their offices. After many tests and interviews $$$n$$$ candidates were selected and the only thing left was their employment.\n\nBecause all candidates have the same skills, it doesn't matter where each of them will work. That is why the company decided to distribute candidates between workplaces so that the total distance between home and workplace over all candidates is minimal.\n\nIt is well known that Earth is round, so it can be described as a circle, and all $$$m$$$ cities on Earth can be described as points on this circle. All cities are enumerated from $$$1$$$ to $$$m$$$ so that for each $$$i$$$ ($$$1 \\le i \\le m - 1$$$) cities with indexes $$$i$$$ and $$$i + 1$$$ are neighbors and cities with indexes $$$1$$$ and $$$m$$$ are neighbors as well. People can move only along the circle. The distance between any two cities equals to minimal number of transitions between neighboring cities you have to perform to get from one city to another. In particular, the distance between the city and itself equals $$$0$$$.\n\nThe \"Poca Pola\" vacancies are located at offices in cities $$$a_1, a_2, \\ldots, a_n$$$. The candidates live in cities $$$b_1, b_2, \\ldots, b_n$$$. It is possible that some vacancies are located in the same cities and some candidates live in the same cities.\n\nThe \"Poca Pola\" managers are too busy with super secret project, so you were asked to help \"Poca Pola\" to distribute candidates between workplaces, so that the sum of the distance between home and workplace over all candidates is minimum possible.\n\n## Constraints\nTime limit per test: 2.0 seconds\nMemory limit per test: 512.0 megabytes\n\n## Input Format\nThe first line contains two integers $$$m$$$ and $$$n$$$ ($$$1 \\le m \\le 10^9$$$, $$$1 \\le n \\le 200\\,000$$$) — the number of cities on Earth and the number of vacancies.\n\nThe second line contains $$$n$$$ integers $$$a_1, a_2, a_3, \\ldots, a_n$$$ ($$$1 \\le a_i \\le m$$$) — the cities where vacancies are located.\n\nThe third line contains $$$n$$$ integers $$$b_1, b_2, b_3, \\ldots, b_n$$$ ($$$1 \\le b_i \\le m$$$) — the cities where the candidates live.\n\n## Output Format\nThe first line should contain the minimum total distance between home and workplace over all candidates.\n\nThe second line should contain $$$n$$$ different integers from $$$1$$$ to $$$n$$$. The $$$i$$$-th of them should be the index of candidate that should work at $$$i$$$-th workplace.\n\n## Examples\n```input\n10 3\n1 5 5\n10 4 6\n```\n```output\n3\n1 2 3\n```\n-----\n```input\n10 3\n1 4 8\n8 3 6\n```\n```output\n4\n2 3 1\n```\n\n## Note\nIn the first example, the distance between each candidate and his workplace equals to $$$1$$$ (from $$$1$$$ to $$$10$$$, from $$$4$$$ to $$$5$$$ and from $$$6$$$ to $$$5$$$).\n\nIn the second example:\n\n- The second candidate works at first workplace, the distance between cities $$$3$$$ and $$$1$$$ equals to $$$2$$$.\n- The third candidate works at second workplace, the distance between cities $$$6$$$ and $$$4$$$ equals to $$$2$$$.\n- The first candidate works at third workplace, the distance between cities $$$8$$$ and $$$8$$$ equals to $$$0$$$.\n\n## Editorial\nFirst, let's notice that the optimal answer can be achieved without changing the relative order of candidates. That means that if we order candidates by circle clockwise, the second candidate will work at the next clockwise workplace from the first candidate's workplace, the third candidate will work at the next clockwise workplace from the second candidate's workplace and so on. Let's prove it. If in optimal answer the order has changed, then there should be 2 candidates, so that the first of them lives earlier clockwise then the second and works at workplace, which is further. If we swap their workplaces, the distance between home and workplace for each of them will either stay the same or decrease. So, doing this swaps, we can achieve the situation, when the relative order of candidates stay the same.\nNow we can come up with simple $$$O(n^2)$$$ solution. Let's first sort all candidates and workplaces by their city number. Let's select some workplace for the first candidate. Because in the optimal answer the order of candidates will not change, for each candidate we know his workplace. Now in $$$O(n)$$$ time we can calculate the total distance. And because there are $$$n$$$ possible workplaces for the first candidate, the solution works in $$$O(n^2)$$$ time.\nTo solve problem faster, let's notice, that if some candidate lives in city with number $$$x$$$ and his workplace has number $$$y$$$, the the total distance from home to work for him will be:\n• $$$-x + y + m$$$ if $$$y < x - m / 2$$$\n• $$$x - y$$$ if $$$x - m / 2 \\le y < x$$$\n• $$$-x + y$$$ if $$$x \\le y < x + m / 2$$$\n• $$$x - y + m$$$ if $$$x + m / 2 \\le y$$$\n",
      "output": "To solve this problem, we need to assign candidates to workplaces such that the sum of the minimal distances between their home cities and workplace cities is minimized. The cities are arranged in a circle, and the distance is the minimal number of steps along the circle between two points.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Sort Arrays**: First, sort both the list of workplace cities and candidate home cities. This helps in efficiently finding the optimal alignment between the two lists.\n2. **Cyclic Shift Check**: For each possible cyclic shift of the candidate home cities list, compute the total distance when aligned with the sorted workplaces list. The optimal alignment is determined by the cyclic shift that results in the minimal total distance.\n3. **Distance Calculation**: For each element in the sorted workplaces list and each candidate cyclic shift, compute the minimal distance considering the circular nature of the cities.\n4. **Track Best Shift**: Keep track of the shift that results in the minimal total distance and use this shift to determine the final assignment of candidates to workplaces.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nimport sys\n\ndef main():\n    m, n = map(int, sys.stdin.readline().split())\n    a = list(map(int, sys.stdin.readline().split()))\n    b = list(map(int, sys.stdin.readline().split()))\n    \n    a_sorted = sorted(a)\n    b_sorted = sorted(b)\n    \n    # To keep track of original indices after sorting\n    original_a_indices = sorted(range(n), key=lambda x: a[x])\n    original_b_indices = sorted(range(n), key=lambda x: b[x])\n    \n    min_total = float('inf')\n    best_k = 0\n    \n    # Precompute all possible sums for each k\n    for k in range(n):\n        total = 0\n        for i in range(n):\n            j = (i + k) % n\n            diff = (b_sorted[j] - a_sorted[i]) % m\n            if diff > m // 2:\n                diff = m - diff\n            total += diff\n            if total >= min_total:\n                break  # Early exit if current total exceeds the minimum found so far\n        if total < min_total:\n            min_total = total\n            best_k = k\n    \n    # Construct the assignment\n    assignment = [0] * n\n    for i in range(n):\n        j = (i + best_k) % n\n        a_pos = original_a_indices[i]\n        b_pos = original_b_indices[j]\n        assignment[a_pos] = b_pos + 1  # Convert to 1-based index\n    \n    print(min_total)\n    print(' '.join(map(str, assignment)))\n\nif __name__ == '__main__':\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Sorting**: The workplace cities (`a`) and candidate home cities (`b`) are sorted to facilitate efficient comparison and alignment.\n2. **Cyclic Shift Calculation**: For each possible cyclic shift `k`, the total distance is computed by aligning the sorted workplaces with the cyclically shifted candidate home cities. The minimal distance for each pair is determined considering the circular nature of the cities.\n3. **Optimal Shift**: The shift `k` that results in the minimal total distance is tracked. This optimal shift is used to determine the final assignment of candidates to workplaces.\n4. **Assignment Construction**: Using the optimal shift, the original indices of the sorted cities are mapped back to their original positions to construct the final assignment list.\n\nThis approach efficiently finds the optimal alignment by leveraging sorting and cyclic shifts, ensuring the minimal total distance is computed in a feasible time frame for large input sizes.",

To establish his power to the neighbouring kingdoms he wants to marry his daughters to the princes of these kingdoms. As a lucky coincidence there are $$$n$$$ other kingdoms as well.\n\nSo Polycarp LXXXIV has enumerated his daughters from $$$1$$$ to $$$n$$$ and the kingdoms from $$$1$$$ to $$$n$$$. For each daughter he has compiled a list of kingdoms princes of which she wanted to marry.\n\nPolycarp LXXXIV is very busy, so he finds a couple for his daughters greedily one after another.\n\nFor the first daughter he takes the kingdom with the lowest number from her list and marries the daughter to their prince. For the second daughter he takes the kingdom with the lowest number from her list, prince of which hasn't been taken already. If there are no free princes in the list then the daughter marries nobody and Polycarp LXXXIV proceeds to the next daughter. The process ends after the $$$n$$$-th daughter.\n\nFor example, let there be $$$4$$$ daughters and kingdoms, the lists daughters have are $$$[2, 3]$$$, $$$[1, 2]$$$, $$$[3, 4]$$$, $$$[3]$$$, respectively.\n\nIn that case daughter $$$1$$$ marries the prince of kingdom $$$2$$$, daughter $$$2$$$ marries the prince of kingdom $$$1$$$, daughter $$$3$$$ marries the prince of kingdom $$$3$$$, leaving daughter $$$4$$$ nobody to marry to.\n\nActually, before starting the marriage process Polycarp LXXXIV has the time to convince one of his daughters that some prince is also worth marrying to. Effectively, that means that he can add exactly one kingdom to exactly one of his daughter's list. Note that this kingdom should not be present in the daughter's list.\n\nPolycarp LXXXIV wants to increase the number of married couples.\n\nUnfortunately, what he doesn't have the time for is determining what entry to add. If there is no way to increase the total number of married couples then output that the marriages are already optimal. Otherwise, find such an entry that the total number of married couples increases if Polycarp LXXXIV adds it.\n\nIf there are multiple ways to add an entry so that the total number of married couples increases then print any of them.\n\nFor your and our convenience you are asked to answer $$$t$$$ independent test cases.\n\n## Constraints\nTime limit per test: 2.0 seconds\nMemory limit per test: 256.0 megabytes\n\n## Input Format\nThe first line contains a single integer $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \\le t \\le 10^5$$$) — the number of test cases.\n\nThen $$$t$$$ test cases follow.\n\nThe first line of each test case contains a single integer $$$n$$$ ($$$1 \\le n \\le 10^5$$$) — the number of daughters and the number of kingdoms.\n\nEach of the next $$$n$$$ lines contains the description of each daughter's list. The first integer $$$k$$$ ($$$0 \\le k \\le n$$$) is the number of entries in the $$$i$$$-th daughter's list. After that $$$k$$$ distinct integers follow $$$g_i[1], g_i[2], \\dots, g_i[k]$$$ ($$$1 \\le g_i[j] \\le n$$$) — the indices of the kingdoms in the list in the increasing order ($$$g_i[1] < g_i[2] < \\dots < g_i[k]$$$).\n\nIt's guaranteed that the total number of daughters over all test cases does not exceed $$$10^5$$$.\n\nIt's also guaranteed that the total number of kingdoms in lists over all test cases does not exceed $$$10^5$$$.\n\n## Output Format\nFor each test case print the answer to it.\n\nPrint \"IMPROVE\" in the first line if Polycarp LXXXIV can add some kingdom to some of his daughter's list so that the total number of married couples increases. The second line then should contain two integers — the index of the daughter and the index of the kingdom Polycarp LXXXIV should add to that daughter's list.\n\nIf there are multiple ways to add an entry so that the total number of married couples increases then print any of them.\n\nOtherwise the only line should contain one word \"OPTIMAL\".\n\n## Examples\n```input\n5\n4\n2 2 3\n2 1 2\n2 3 4\n1 3\n2\n0\n0\n3\n3 1 2 3\n3 1 2 3\n3 1 2 3\n1\n1 1\n4\n1 1\n1 2\n1 3\n1 4\n```\n```output\nIMPROVE\n4 4\nIMPROVE\n1 1\nOPTIMAL\nOPTIMAL\nOPTIMAL\n```\n\n## Note\nThe first test case is depicted in the statement. Adding the fourth kingdom to the list of the fourth daughter makes her marry the prince of the fourth kingdom.\n\nIn the second test case any new entry will increase the number of marriages from $$$0$$$ to $$$1$$$.\n\nIn the third and the fourth test cases there is no way to add an entry.\n\nIn the fifth test case there is no way to change the marriages by adding any entry.\n\n## Editorial\nSimulate the process without adding the new entry. For this you can just maintain an array $$$taken$$$, $$$i$$$-th value of which is true if the $$$i$$$-th prince is married and false otherwise.\nNow observe that there are two possible outcomes:\n1. Every daughter is married — the answer is optimal.\n2. There is a daughter who isn't married. That means that there is a free prince as well. Marry them to each other because doing that won't affect any other marriages and add a new one to the answer.\nOverall complexity: $$$O(n + m)$$$.\n",

      "output": "To solve this problem, we need to count the number of valid configurations of a binary tree after some vertices may fall off, and fruits are assigned to the remaining vertices such that each vertex's fruit count is at least the sum of its children's fruit counts. The solution involves dynamic programming (DP) and efficient tree traversal to handle large input constraints.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Tree Representation**: Represent the tree using an adjacency list to facilitate efficient traversal.\n2. **Dynamic Programming (DP)**: Use a post-order traversal to compute the number of valid configurations for each subtree. For each node, the DP value represents the number of valid configurations when the node is kept.\n3. **Modular Arithmetic**: Since the result can be large, use modulo 998244353 for all calculations to handle overflow and meet the problem's requirements.\n\n### Solution Code\n```cpp\n#include <bits/stdc++.h>\nusing namespace std;\n\nusing ll = long long;\nconst int MOD = 998244353;\nvector<vector<int>> adj;\n\nll modpow(ll a, ll b) {\n    ll res = 1;\n    while (b) {\n        if (b & 1) res = res * a % MOD;\n        a = a * a % MOD;\n        b >>= 1;\n    }\n    return res;\n}\n\nll dfs(int u, int parent, ll x) {\n    ll product = 1;\n    for (int v : adj[u]) {\n        if (v == parent) continue;\n        ll child = dfs(v, u, x);\n        product = product * (1 + child) % MOD;\n    }\n    return (x % MOD) * product % MOD;\n}\n\nint main() {\n    ios_base::sync_with_stdio(false);\n    cin.tie(nullptr);\n\n    int n; ll x;\n    cin >> n >> x;\n    adj.resize(n + 1);\n\n    for (int i = 0; i < n - 1; ++i) {\n        int a, b;\n        cin >> a >> b;\n        adj[a].push_back(b);\n        adj[b].push_back(a);\n    }\n\n    ll root_contribution = dfs(1, -1, x + 1);\n    ll ans = (root_contribution + 1) % MOD;\n    cout << ans << endl;\n\n    return 0;\n}\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Tree Traversal**: The tree is traversed using depth-first search (DFS) starting from the root. This ensures that each node's children are processed before the node itself.\n2. **Dynamic Programming**: For each node, the number of valid configurations is computed by considering all possible configurations of its children. The product of (1 + child's configurations) accounts for both keeping and not keeping each child.\n3. **Modular Arithmetic**: All operations are performed modulo 998244353 to handle large numbers and prevent overflow. The result for each node is computed as `(x % MOD) * product % MOD`, where `product` is the combined result of the node's children.\n\nThis approach efficiently computes the number of valid configurations using dynamic programming and modular arithmetic, ensuring it handles the maximum input constraints within the given time and memory limits.",

Stumbled on an issue of «TopShop», the Hedgehog was about to change the channel when all of a sudden he was stopped by an advertisement of a new wondrous invention.\n\nActually, a vacuum cleaner was advertised there. It was called Marvellous Vacuum and it doesn't even need a human to operate it while it cleans! The vacuum cleaner can move around the flat on its own: it moves in some direction and if it hits an obstacle there, it automatically chooses a new direction. Sooner or later this vacuum cleaner will travel through all the room and clean it all. Having remembered how much time the Hedgehog spends every time on cleaning (surely, no less than a half of the day), he got eager to buy this wonder.\n\nHowever, the Hedgehog quickly understood that the cleaner has at least one weak point: it won't clean well in the room's corners because it often won't able to reach the corner due to its shape. To estimate how serious is this drawback in practice, the Hedgehog asked you to write for him the corresponding program.\n\nYou will be given the cleaner's shape in the top view. We will consider only the cases when the vacuum cleaner is represented as a convex polygon. The room is some infinitely large rectangle. We consider one corner of this room and want to find such a rotation of the vacuum cleaner so that it, being pushed into this corner, will leave the minimum possible area in the corner uncovered.\n\n## Constraints\nTime limit per test: 1.0 seconds\nMemory limit per test: 256.0 megabytes\n\n## Input Format\nThe first line contains an integer N which represents the number of vertices of the vacuum cleaner's polygon (3 ≤ N ≤ 4·104). Then follow N lines each containing two numbers — the coordinates of a vertex of the polygon. All the coordinates are integer and their absolute values do not exceed 106.\n\nIt is guaranteed that the given polygon is nondegenerate and convex (no three points lie on the same line). The polygon vertices are given in a clockwise or counter-clockwise direction.\n\n## Output Format\nPrint the minimum possible uncovered area. The answer will be accepted if it is within 10 - 6 of absolute or relative error from the correct answer.\n\n## Examples\n```input\n4\n0 0\n1 0\n1 1\n0 1\n```\n```output\n0.00000000000000000000\n```\n-----\n```input\n8\n1 2\n2 1\n2 -1\n1 -2\n-1 -2\n-2 -1\n-2 1\n-1 2\n```\n```output\n0.50000000000000000000\n```\n\n",
      "output": "To solve this problem, we need to determine the optimal rotation of a convex polygon such that when placed into a corner (origin), the uncovered area in the corner is minimized. The key insight is to minimize the product of the minimum x and y coordinates of the polygon vertices after rotation, which corresponds to the area of the right triangle formed by these coordinates.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Problem Analysis**: The problem requires finding the optimal rotation of a convex polygon to minimize the uncovered area in the corner. The uncovered area can be represented as half the product of the minimum x and y coordinates of the polygon vertices after rotation.\n2. **Key Insight**: The minimum uncovered area is determined by the product of the minimum x and y coordinates of the polygon vertices after rotation. We need to find the rotation angle that minimizes this product.\n3. **Algorithm Selection**: We use a ternary search over the interval [0, π] to efficiently find the optimal rotation angle. For each angle, we compute the minimum x and y coordinates of the rotated vertices and their product.\n4. **Complexity**: The ternary search runs in O(log(1/ε)) iterations, where ε is the precision required. Each iteration processes all N vertices in O(N) time, resulting in an overall complexity of O(N log(1/ε)), which is efficient for the given constraints.\n\n### Solution Code\n```cpp\n#include <iostream>\n#include <vector>\n#include <cmath>\n#include <iomanip>\n\nusing namespace std;\n\nstruct Point {\n    double x, y;\n};\n\nvector<Point> points;\n\ndouble compute_product(double theta) {\n    double cos_theta = cos(theta);\n    double sin_theta = sin(theta);\n    double min_x = 1e20;\n    double min_y = 1e20;\n    for (const auto& p : points) {\n        double x = p.x * cos_theta - p.y * sin_theta;\n        double y = p.x * sin_theta + p.y * cos_theta;\n        if (x < min_x) min_x = x;\n        if (y < min_y) min_y = y;\n    }\n    return min_x * min_y;\n}\n\nint main() {\n    ios::sync_with_stdio(false);\n    cin.tie(nullptr);\n    \n    int N;\n    cin >> N;\n    points.resize(N);\n    for (int i = 0; i < N; ++i) {\n        cin >> points[i].x >> points[i].y;\n    }\n    \n    double left = 0.0;\n    double right = M_PI;\n    double best_product = 1e20;\n    const int iterations = 200;\n    \n    for (int iter = 0; iter < iterations; ++iter) {\n        double mid1 = left + (right - left) / 3;\n        double mid2 = right - (right - left) / 3;\n        double p1 = compute_product(mid1);\n        double p2 = compute_product(mid2);\n        if (p1 < p2) {\n            right = mid2;\n            if (p1 < best_product) {\n                best_product = p1;\n            }\n        } else {\n            left = mid1;\n            if (p2 < best_product) {\n                best_product = p2;\n            }\n        }\n    }\n    \n    // Check additional points in the current interval to handle possible minima\n    const int check_steps = 1000;\n    double step = (right - left) / check_steps;\n    for (int i = 0; i <= check_steps; ++i) {\n        double theta = left + i * step;\n        double p = compute_product(theta);\n        if (p < best_product) {\n            best_product = p;\n        }\n    }\n    \n    // Compute a and b for the best_product\n    double best_theta = left;\n    double min_p = compute_product(best_theta);\n    for (int i = 0; i <= check_steps; ++i) {\n        double theta = left + i * step;\n        double p = compute_product(theta);\n        if (p < min_p) {\n            min_p = p;\n            best_theta = theta;\n        }\n    }\n    \n    double cos_theta = cos(best_theta);\n    double sin_theta = sin(best_theta);\n    double a = 1e20, b = 1e20;\n    for (const auto& p : points) {\n        double x = p.x * cos_theta - p.y * sin_theta;\n        double y = p.x * sin_theta + p.y * cos_theta;\n        if (x < a) a = x;\n        if (y < b) b = y;\n    }\n    \n    double result = a * b / 2.0;\n    cout << fixed << setprecision(20) << result << endl;\n    \n    return 0;\n}\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The polygon vertices are read and stored.\n2. **Ternary Search**: The ternary search is performed over the interval [0, π] to find the rotation angle that minimizes the product of the minimum x and y coordinates of the vertices after rotation.\n3. **Grid Search**: A grid search within the final interval from the ternary search ensures that we do not miss any local minima.\n4. **Result Calculation**: After determining the optimal angle, the minimum x and y coordinates are computed, and the result is calculated as half their product.\n\nThis approach efficiently finds the optimal rotation using a combination of ternary and grid searches, ensuring both accuracy and performance within the problem constraints.",

A bracket sequence is called regular (shortly, RBS) if it is possible to obtain correct arithmetic expression by inserting characters \"+\" and \"1\" into this sequence. For example, \"\", \"(())\" and \"()()\" are RBS and \")(\" and \"(()\" are not.\n\nWe can see that each opening bracket in RBS is paired with some closing bracket, and, using this fact, we can define nesting depth of the RBS as maximum number of bracket pairs, such that the $$$2$$$-nd pair lies inside the $$$1$$$-st one, the $$$3$$$-rd one — inside the $$$2$$$-nd one and so on. For example, nesting depth of \"\" is $$$0$$$, \"()()()\" is $$$1$$$ and \"()((())())\" is $$$3$$$.\n\nNow, you are given RBS $$$s$$$ of even length $$$n$$$. You should color each bracket of $$$s$$$ into one of two colors: red or blue. Bracket sequence $$$r$$$, consisting only of red brackets, should be RBS, and bracket sequence, consisting only of blue brackets $$$b$$$, should be RBS. Any of them can be empty. You are not allowed to reorder characters in $$$s$$$, $$$r$$$ or $$$b$$$. No brackets can be left uncolored.\n\nAmong all possible variants you should choose one that minimizes maximum of $$$r$$$'s and $$$b$$$'s nesting depth.

From the other side we can always reach equation $$$\\max(d(r), d(b)) = \\left\\lceil \\frac{d(s)}{2} \\right\\rceil$$$ using some approaches.\nLet's look at prefix of length $$$i$$$ of string $$$s$$$. Let $$$o_s(i)$$$ be number of opening bracket in the prefix, $$$c_s(i)$$$ — number of closing brackets. Then we can define balance of the $$$i$$$-th prefix of $$$s$$$ as $$$bal_s(i) = o_s(i) - c_s(i)$$$.\nThe author's approach is next:\nLet's define level of pair of brackets (matched in natural way) as $$$bal_s(i - 1)$$$, where $$$i$$$ is position of opening bracket of this pair. Then we will color in red all pairs with even level and in blue — with odd level.\n—— Proof of $$$\\max(d(r), d(b)) \\ge \\left\\lceil \\frac{d(s)}{2} \\right\\rceil$$$:\nIt can be shown that $$$d(s) = \\max\\limits_{1 \\le i \\le n}(bal_s(i))$$$ and exists such $$$pos$$$ that $$$d(s) = bal_s(pos)$$$.\nAfter any coloring of $$$s$$$ we can define number of opening/closing red (blue) brackets of $$$pos$$$-th prefix of $$$s$$$ as $$$o_r(pos)$$$ ($$$o_b(pos)$$$) and $$$c_r(pos)$$$ ($$$c_b(pos)$$$) respectively. Since $$$o_s(pos) = o_r(pos) + o_b(pos)$$$ and $$$c_s(pos) = c_r(pos) + c_b(pos)$$$, then $$$$$$\\max(bal_r(pos), bal_b(pos)) = \\max(o_r(pos) - c_r(pos), bal_b(pos)) \\\\ = \\max((o_s(pos) - o_b(pos)) - (c_s(pos) - c_b(pos)), bal_b(pos)) = \\max((o_s(pos) - c_s(pos)) - (o_b(pos) - c_b(pos)), bal_b(pos)) \\\\ = \\max(bal_s(pos) - bal_b(pos), bal_b(pos)) \\ge \\left\\lceil \\frac{bal_s(pos)}{2} \\right\\rceil = \\left\\lceil \\frac{d(s)}{2} \\right\\rceil.$$$$$$\nFinally, $$$$$$\\max(d(a), d(b)) = \\max(\\max\\limits_{1 \\le i \\le n}(bal_r(i)), \\max\\limits_{1 \\le i \\le n}(bal_b(i))) \\\\ = \\max\\limits_{1 \\le i, j \\le n}(\\max(bal_r(i), bal_b(j))) \\ge \\max(bal_r(pos), bal_b(pos)) \\ge \\left\\lceil \\frac{d(s)}{2} \\right\\rceil$$$$$$\n",

      "output": "To solve this problem, we need to determine the maximum size of a tower for each color in a sequence of blocks placed on a grid. A tower is defined as a vertical stack of blocks of the same color with consecutive y-coordinates in the same column. The blocks must be placed in order, with each new block adjacent to the previous one (left, right, or up), but not below.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Track Positions and Counts**: For each color, maintain a dictionary that tracks the highest y-coordinate and the count of consecutive blocks in each column. This helps in determining the longest vertical sequence (tower) for each color.\n2. **Dynamic Placement**: For each block, check if it can be placed in an existing column of the same color to extend the tower. If possible, update the column's highest y-coordinate and the consecutive count. If not, start a new column.\n3. **Update Maximum Count**: Keep track of the maximum tower size for each color as blocks are processed.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nimport sys\nfrom collections import defaultdict\n\ndef main():\n    input = sys.stdin.read().split()\n    ptr = 0\n    t = int(input[ptr])\n    ptr += 1\n    for _ in range(t):\n        n = int(input[ptr])\n        ptr += 1\n        c = list(map(int, input[ptr:ptr + n]))\n        ptr += n\n        \n        color_info = defaultdict(dict)  # color -> {x: (last_y, max_consecutive)}\n        max_count = defaultdict(int)\n        x, y = 0, 0\n        current_color = c[0]\n        color_info[current_color][x] = (y, 1)\n        max_count[current_color] = 1\n        \n        for i in range(1, n):\n            current_color = c[i]\n            best_consec = 1\n            best_x = None\n            best_y = None\n            remove_x = []\n            \n            for x_prev in color_info.get(current_color, {}):\n                last_y_prev, cnt_prev = color_info[current_color][x_prev]\n                new_y = last_y_prev + 1\n                new_consec = cnt_prev + 1\n                if new_consec > best_consec:\n                    best_consec = new_consec\n                    best_x = x_prev\n                    best_y = new_y\n            \n            if best_x is not None:\n                color_info[current_color][best_x] = (best_y, best_consec)\n                if best_consec > max_count[current_color]:\n                    max_count[current_color] = best_consec\n                new_x, new_y = best_x, best_y\n            else:\n                possible_x = x + 1\n                possible_y = y\n                new_x, new_y = possible_x, possible_y\n                color_info[current_color][new_x] = (possible_y, 1)\n                if 1 > max_count[current_color]:\n                    max_count[current_color] = 1\n            \n            x, y = new_x, new_y\n        \n        res = []\n        for r in range(1, n+1):\n            res.append(str(max_count.get(r, 0)))\n        print(' '.join(res))\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The input is read in one go for efficiency, especially given the constraints.\n2. **Initialization**: For each test case, initialize the position of the first block and track its color.\n3. **Processing Blocks**: For each subsequent block, determine the optimal placement to either extend an existing tower of the same color or start a new column.\n4. **Update Tracking**: Maintain the highest y-coordinate and the count of consecutive blocks for each color in each column. Update the maximum tower size for each color accordingly.\n5. **Output**: After processing all blocks, generate the result for each color from 1 to n, ensuring non-present colors return 0.\n\nThis approach efficiently tracks the necessary information using dictionaries and ensures optimal performance within the problem constraints.",

Through a mutual friend, he's figured out that Anji really likes binary trees and decided to solve her problem in order to get her attention.\n\nAnji has given Keksic a binary tree with $$$n$$$ vertices. Vertex $$$1$$$ is the root and does not have a parent. All other vertices have exactly one parent. Each vertex can have up to $$$2$$$ children, a left child, and a right child. For each vertex, Anji tells Keksic index of both its left and its right child or tells him that they do not exist.\n\nAdditionally, each of the vertices has a letter $$$s_i$$$ on it, which is either 'U', 'L' or 'R'.\n\nKeksic begins his journey on the root, and in each move he does the following:\n\n- If the letter on his current vertex is 'U', he moves to its parent. If it doesn't exist, he does nothing.\n- If the letter on his current vertex is 'L', he moves to its left child. If it doesn't exist, he does nothing.\n- If the letter on his current vertex is 'R', he moves to its right child. If it doesn't exist, he does nothing.\n\nYou are interested in the minimal number of operations he needs to do before his journey, such that when he starts his journey, he will reach a leaf at some point. A leaf is a vertex that has no children. It does not matter which leaf he reaches. Note that it does not matter whether he will stay in the leaf, he just needs to move to it. Additionally, note that it does not matter how many times he needs to move before reaching a leaf.\n\nHelp Keksic solve Anji's tree so that he can win her heart, and make her come to Čačak.\n\n## Constraints\nTime limit per test: 2.5 seconds\nMemory limit per test: 256.0 megabytes\n\n## Input Format\nEach test consists of multiple test cases.

If $$$l_i = 0$$$, it means that vertex $$$i$$$ does not have a left child. If $$$r_i = 0$$$, it means that vertex $$$i$$$ does not have a right child. It is guaranteed that this data describes a valid binary tree rooted at $$$1$$$.\n\nIt is guaranteed that the sum of $$$n$$$ over all test cases does not exceed $$$3 \\cdot 10^5$$$.\n\n## Output Format\nFor each test case, output a single integer — the minimal number of operations Keksic needs to do to reach a leaf.\n\n## Examples\n```input\n5\n3\nLRU\n2 3\n0 0\n0 0\n3\nULR\n3 2\n0 0\n0 0\n2\nLU\n0 2\n0 0\n4\nRULR\n3 0\n0 0\n0 4\n2 0\n7\nLLRRRLU\n5 2\n3 6\n0 0\n7 0\n4 0\n0 0\n0 0\n```\n```output\n0\n1\n1\n3\n1\n```\n\n## Note\nIn the first test case, vertex $$$1$$$ has $$$2$$$ as its left child and $$$3$$$ as its right child. Vertices $$$2$$$ and $$$3$$$ do not have children and are therefore leaves. As 'L' is written on vertex $$$1$$$, Keksic will go to vertex $$$2$$$, therefore he has to do no operations.\n\nIn the second test case, vertex $$$1$$$ has $$$3$$$ as its left child and $$$2$$$ as its right child. Vertices $$$2$$$ and $$$3$$$ are leaves. As 'U' is written on vertex $$$1$$$, Keksic needs to change it to either 'L' or 'R' in order for him to reach a leaf.\n\nIn the third case, vertex $$$1$$$ has only a right child, which is vertex $$$2$$$. As 'L' is written on it, Keksic needs to change it to 'R', otherwise he would be stuck on vertex $$$1$$$.\n\nIn the fourth case, he can change $$$3$$$ characters so that letters on the vertices are \"LURL\", which makes him reach vertex $$$2$$$.\n\nIn the fifth case, there are $$$3$$$ leaves, $$$3$$$, $$$6$$$ and $$$7$$$. To reach either leaf $$$6$$$ or leaf $$$7$$$, he needs to change $$$2$$$ characters. However, if he changes character on vertex $$$1$$$ to 'R', he will reach leaf $$$3$$$, therefore the answer is $$$1$$$.\n\nThe initial tree in test case 5.\n\n## Editorial\nLet us look at some node $$$x$$$ which is not the root. $$$y$$$ is $$$x$$$'s parent.\nThe number of operations required to get from the root to $$$x$$$ is equal to the sum of the number of operations required to get from the root to $$$y$$$ and the number of operations required to get from $$$y$$$ to $$$x$$$.\nIf $$$x$$$ is the left child of $$$y$$$: the number of operations required to get from $$$y$$$ to $$$x$$$ is $$$0$$$ if the letter written on $$$y$$$ is $$$L$$$, and it is $$$1$$$ in the cases of other letters.\nIf $$$x$$$ is the right child of $$$y$$$: the number of operations required to get from $$$y$$$ to $$$x$$$ is $$$0$$$ if the letter written on $$$y$$$ is $$$R$$$, and it is $$$1$$$ in the cases of other letters.\nWe can run DFS through the tree, and using dynamic programming calculate the number of operations needed to get to the each of the nodes.\nThe answer is the minimal number of operations required to get to a leaf.\n",

Okabe's city can be represented as all points (x, y) such that x and y are non-negative. Okabe starts at the origin (point (0, 0)), and needs to reach the point (k, 0). If Okabe is currently at the point (x, y), in one step he can go to (x + 1, y + 1), (x + 1, y), or (x + 1, y - 1).\n\nAdditionally, there are n horizontal line segments, the i-th of which goes from x = ai to x = bi inclusive, and is at y = ci. It is guaranteed that a1 = 0, an ≤ k ≤ bn, and ai = bi - 1 for 2 ≤ i ≤ n. The i-th line segment forces Okabe to walk with y-value in the range 0 ≤ y ≤ ci when his x value satisfies ai ≤ x ≤ bi, or else he might be spied on. This also means he is required to be under two line segments when one segment ends and another begins.\n\nOkabe now wants to know how many walks there are from the origin to the point (k, 0) satisfying these conditions, modulo 109 + 7.\n\n## Constraints\nTime limit per test: 2.0 seconds\nMemory limit per test: 256.0 megabytes\n\n## Input Format\nThe first line of input contains the integers n and k (1 ≤ n ≤ 100, 1 ≤ k ≤ 1018) — the number of segments and the destination x coordinate.\n\nThe next n lines contain three space-separated integers ai, bi, and ci (0 ≤ ai < bi ≤ 1018, 0 ≤ ci ≤ 15) — the left and right ends of a segment, and its y coordinate.\n\nIt is guaranteed that a1 = 0, an ≤ k ≤ bn, and ai = bi - 1 for 2 ≤ i ≤ n.\n\n## Output Format\nPrint the number of walks satisfying the conditions, modulo 1000000007 (109 + 7).\n\n## Examples\n```input\n1 3\n0 3 3\n```\n```output\n4\n```\n-----\n```input\n2 6\n0 3 0\n3 10 2\n```\n```output\n4\n```\n\n## Note\nThe graph above corresponds to sample 1.

It's just f(x - 1, y + 1) + f(x - 1, y) + f(x - 1, y - 1), being careful about staying above x axis and under or on any segments.\nTo speed it up, note that the transitions are independent of x. This is screaming matrix multiplication! We can make a 16x16 matrix, where the entry (i,j) is 1 if we can go from y value of i to y value of j in one move. You can build this quickly and then matrix exponentiate for under every segment, then carry the DP values of the end of that segment over to start the next segment.

It is the xor-sum of tastinesses that matters, not the ordinary sum!\n\nA xor-sum of a sequence of integers a1, a2, ..., am is defined as the bitwise XOR of all its elements: $$a_{1} \\oplus a_{2} \\oplus \\ldots \\oplus a_{m}$$, here $$\\bigcirc$$ denotes the bitwise XOR operation; more about bitwise XOR can be found here.\n\nDed Moroz warned Grisha he has more houses to visit, so Grisha can take no more than k candies from the bag.

Little Petya has n towers consisting of cubes of the same size. Tower with number i consists of ai cubes stacked one on top of the other. Petya defines the instability of a set of towers as a value equal to the difference between the heights of the highest and the lowest of the towers. For example, if Petya built five cube towers with heights (8, 3, 2, 6, 3), the instability of this set is equal to 6 (the highest tower has height 8, the lowest one has height 2).\n\nThe boy wants the instability of his set of towers to be as low as possible. All he can do is to perform the following operation several times: take the top cube from some tower and put it on top of some other tower of his set. Please note that Petya would never put the cube on the same tower from which it was removed because he thinks it's a waste of time.\n\nBefore going to school, the boy will have time to perform no more than k such operations. Petya does not want to be late for class, so you have to help him accomplish this task.\n\n## Constraints\nTime limit per test: 1.0 seconds\nMemory limit per test: 256.0 megabytes\n\n## Input Format\nThe first line contains two space-separated positive integers n and k (1 ≤ n ≤ 100, 1 ≤ k ≤ 1000) — the number of towers in the given set and the maximum number of operations Petya can perform. The second line contains n space-separated positive integers ai (1 ≤ ai ≤ 104) — the towers' initial heights.\n\n## Output Format\nIn the first line print two space-separated non-negative integers s and m (m ≤ k). The first number is the value of the minimum possible instability that can be obtained after performing at most k operations, the second number is the number of operations needed for that.\n\nIn the next m lines print the description of each operation as two positive integers i and j, each of them lies within limits from 1 to n. They represent that Petya took the top cube from the i-th tower and put in on the j-th one (i ≠ j). Note that in the process of performing operations the heights of some towers can become equal to zero.\n\nIf there are multiple correct sequences at which the minimum possible instability is achieved, you are allowed to print any of them.\n\n## Examples\n```input\n3 2\n5 8 5\n```\n```output\n0 2\n2 1\n2 3\n```\n-----\n```input\n3 4\n2 2 4\n```\n```output\n1 1\n3 2\n```\n-----\n```input\n5 3\n8 3 2 6 3\n```\n```output\n3 3\n1 3\n1 2\n1 3\n```\n\n## Note\nIn the first sample you need to move the cubes two times, from the second tower to the third one and from the second one to the first one.

But must perform the operation anyway. We can get $$$f(p)=3$$$ by choosing $$$i=1$$$ and $$$j=2$$$ which makes $$$p = [2,1,3,4,5]$$$.\n\nIn the second test case, we can transform $$$p$$$ into $$$[1,2,3,4,5]$$$ by choosing $$$i=1$$$ and $$$j=2$$$. Thus $$$f(p)=5$$$.\n\n## Editorial\nThe key observation to this problem is that most swaps are useless. In fact, we can find that only $$$2n$$$ swaps can increase our initial cost:\n• The first type of meaningful swaps is $$$(i,p_i)$$$\n• For each $$$1 < i < n$$$, consider $$$k$$$ and $$$l$$$ such that $$$p_k = max(p_1,p_2,...,p_{i-1})$$$ and $$$p_l = min(p_{i+1},p_{i+2},...,p_n)$$$. The second type is $$$(k,l)$$$.\nThe reason why this is true is because the first type of swap can create a new good index ( since every good index must be a fixed point ) and the second type of swap can fix an already good index. It's obvious that if a swap does neither of the above, it can't increase our current cost.\nCalculating $$$f(p)$$$ after each swap can be done with a segment tree. Consider adding one on the ranges $$$(min(i,p_i),max(i,p_i))$$$. Now an index is good if and only if its value is $$$1$$$, which is also the minimum value an index can have. Thus our segment tree has to find the number of minimums while performing range additions which can be easily maintained by lazy propagation.\nThis solution works in $$$O(nlog(n))$$$ time complexity.\n",
      "output": "To solve this problem, we need to maximize the number of good indices in a permutation after performing exactly one swap.

It has $$$n$$$ rooms numbered from $$$0$$$ to $$$n-1$$$. For every pair of rooms, $$$a$$$ and $$$b$$$, there's either a direct passage from room $$$a$$$ to room $$$b$$$, or from room $$$b$$$ to room $$$a$$$, but never both.\n\nBaby Ehab wants to go play with Baby Badawy. He wants to know if he could get to him. However, he doesn't know anything about his apartment except the number of rooms. He can ask the baby sitter two types of questions:\n\n- is the passage between room $$$a$$$ and room $$$b$$$ directed from $$$a$$$ to $$$b$$$ or the other way around?\n- does room $$$x$$$ have a passage towards any of the rooms $$$s_1$$$, $$$s_2$$$, ..., $$$s_k$$$?\n\nHe can ask at most $$$9n$$$ queries of the first type and at most $$$2n$$$ queries of the second type.\n\nAfter asking some questions, he wants to know for every pair of rooms $$$a$$$ and $$$b$$$ whether there's a path from $$$a$$$ to $$$b$$$ or not. A path from $$$a$$$ to $$$b$$$ is a sequence of passages that starts from room $$$a$$$ and ends at room $$$b$$$.\n\n## Constraints\nTime limit per test: 1.0 seconds\nMemory limit per test: 256.0 megabytes\n\n## Input Format\nThe first line contains an integer $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \\le t \\le 30$$$) — the number of test cases you need to solve.\n\nThen each test case starts with an integer $$$n$$$ ($$$4 \\le n \\le 100$$$) — the number of rooms.\n\nThe sum of $$$n$$$ across the test cases doesn't exceed $$$500$$$.\n\n## Output Format\nTo print the answer for a test case, print a line containing \"3\", followed by $$$n$$$ lines, each containing a binary string of length $$$n$$$. The $$$j$$$-th character of the $$$i$$$-th string should be $$$1$$$ if there's a path from room $$$i$$$ to room $$$j$$$, and $$$0$$$ if there isn't. The $$$i$$$-th character of the $$$i$$$-th string should be $$$1$$$ for each valid $$$i$$$.\n\nAfter printing the answer, we will respond with a single integer. If it's $$$1$$$, you printed a correct answer and should keep solving the test cases (or exit if it is the last one). If it's $$$-1$$$, you printed a wrong answer and should terminate to get Wrong answer verdict. Otherwise, you can get an arbitrary verdict because your solution will continue to read from a closed stream.\n\n## Examples\n```input\n1\n4\n\n0\n\n0\n\n1\n\n1\n\n1\n```\n```output\n2 3 3 0 1 2\n\n1 0 1\n\n1 0 2\n\n2 2 1 1\n\n3\n1111\n1111\n1111\n0001\n```\n\n## Note\nIn the given example:\n\nThe first query asks whether there's a passage from room $$$3$$$ to any of the other rooms.\n\nThe second query asks about the direction of the passage between rooms $$$0$$$ and $$$1$$$.\n\nAfter a couple other queries, we concluded that you can go from any room to any other room except if you start at room $$$3$$$, and you can't get out of this room, so we printed the matrix:\n\nThe interactor answered with $$$1$$$, telling us the answer is correct.\n",

The first candidate received $$$a$$$ votes, the second one received $$$b$$$ votes, the third one received $$$c$$$ votes. For each candidate, solve the following problem: how many votes should be added to this candidate so that he wins the election (i.e. the number of votes for this candidate was strictly greater than the number of votes for any other candidate)?\n\nPlease note that for each candidate it is necessary to solve this problem independently, i.e. the added votes for any candidate do not affect the calculations when getting the answer for the other two candidates.\n\n## Constraints\nTime limit per test: 1.0 seconds\nMemory limit per test: 256.0 megabytes\n\n## Input Format\nThe first line contains one integer $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \\le t \\le 10^4$$$) — the number of test cases.

To win the election, he needs to get at least $$$1$$$ more votes than every other candidate. Therefore, the first candidate needs to get at least $$$\\max(b, c) + 1$$$ votes. If $$$a$$$ is already greater than this value, then you don't need to add any votes, otherwise, you need to add $$$\\max(b, c) + 1 - a$$$ votes. So the answer for the first candidate is $$$\\max(0, \\max(b,c) + 1 - a)$$$.\nSimilarly, the answer for the second candidate is $$$\\max(0, \\max(a, c) + 1 - b)$$$, and, for the third one, the answer is $$$\\max(0, \\max(a, b) + 1 - c)$$$.\n",

Students like to dream of a beautiful life, so they used champagne glasses to construct a small pyramid. The height of the pyramid is n. The top level consists of only 1 glass, that stands on 2 glasses on the second level (counting from the top), then 3 glasses on the third level and so on.The bottom level consists of n glasses.\n\nVlad has seen in the movies many times how the champagne beautifully flows from top levels to bottom ones, filling all the glasses simultaneously. So he took a bottle and started to pour it in the glass located at the top of the pyramid.\n\nEach second, Vlad pours to the top glass the amount of champagne equal to the size of exactly one glass. If the glass is already full, but there is some champagne flowing in it, then it pours over the edge of the glass and is equally distributed over two glasses standing under. If the overflowed glass is at the bottom level, then the champagne pours on the table. For the purpose of this problem we consider that champagne is distributed among pyramid glasses immediately. Vlad is interested in the number of completely full glasses if he stops pouring champagne in t seconds.\n\nPictures below illustrate the pyramid consisting of three levels.\n\n## Constraints\nTime limit per test: 1.0 seconds\nMemory limit per test: 256.0 megabytes\n\n## Input Format\nThe only line of the input contains two integers n and t (1 ≤ n ≤ 10, 0 ≤ t ≤ 10 000) — the height of the pyramid and the number of seconds Vlad will be pouring champagne from the bottle.\n\n## Output Format\nPrint the single integer — the number of completely full glasses after t seconds.\n\n## Examples\n```input\n3 5\n```\n```output\n4\n```\n-----\n```input\n4 8\n```\n```output\n6\n```\n\n## Note\nIn the first sample, the glasses full after 5 seconds are: the top glass, both glasses on the second level and the middle glass at the bottom level.

He always starts and plays with Xs. He played a lot of games today with his friend Arseny. The friends became tired and didn't finish the last game. It was Ilya's turn in the game when they left it. Determine whether Ilya could have won the game by making single turn or not.\n\nThe rules of tic-tac-toe on the 4 × 4 field are as follows. Before the first turn all the field cells are empty. The two players take turns placing their signs into empty cells (the first player places Xs, the second player places Os). The player who places Xs goes first, the another one goes second. The winner is the player who first gets three of his signs in a row next to each other (horizontal, vertical or diagonal).\n\n## Constraints\nTime limit per test: 2.0 seconds\nMemory limit per test: 256.0 megabytes\n\n## Input Format\nThe tic-tac-toe position is given in four lines.\n\nEach of these lines contains four characters. Each character is '.' (empty cell), 'x' (lowercase English letter x), or 'o' (lowercase English letter o). It is guaranteed that the position is reachable playing tic-tac-toe, and it is Ilya's turn now (in particular, it means that the game is not finished). It is possible that all the cells are empty, it means that the friends left without making single turn.\n\n## Output Format\nPrint single line: \"YES\" in case Ilya could have won by making single turn, and \"NO\" otherwise.\n\n## Examples\n```input\nxx..\n.oo.\nx...\noox.\n```\n```output\nYES\n```\n-----\n```input\nx.ox\nox..\nx.o.\noo.x\n```\n```output\nNO\n```\n-----\n```input\nx..x\n..oo\no...\nx.xo\n```\n```output\nYES\n```\n-----\n```input\no.x.\no...\n.x..\nooxx\n```\n```output\nNO\n```\n\n## Note\nIn the first example Ilya had two winning moves: to the empty cell in the left column and to the leftmost empty cell in the first row.\n\nIn the second example it wasn't possible to win by making single turn.\n\nIn the third example Ilya could have won by placing X in the last row between two existing Xs.\n\nIn the fourth example it wasn't possible to win by making single turn.\n\n## Editorial\nThis problem can be solved by simple bruteforce. Let's brute cell in which Ilya put X. Let's put X in this cell. Next step is to check if there is three consecutive Xs on field. This is done as follows. Let's brute cell which is first of three consecutive Xs. Next let's brute direction of three consecutive Xs. If we know first cell and direction, we should check that there is three consecutive cells from first cell towards fixed direction.\n",

You have heard that there is a treasure hidden in one of n possible spots in the caves. You assume that each of the spots has probability 1 / n to contain a treasure.\n\nYou cannot get into the caves yourself, so you have constructed a robot that can search the caves for treasure. Each day you can instruct the robot to visit exactly k distinct spots in the caves. If none of these spots contain treasure, then the robot will obviously return with empty hands. However, the caves are dark, and the robot may miss the treasure even when visiting the right spot. Formally, if one of the visited spots does contain a treasure, the robot will obtain it with probability 1 / 2, otherwise it will return empty. Each time the robot searches the spot with the treasure, his success probability is independent of all previous tries (that is, the probability to miss the treasure after searching the right spot x times is 1 / 2x).\n\nWhat is the expected number of days it will take to obtain the treasure if you choose optimal scheduling for the robot? Output the answer as a rational number modulo 109 + 7. Formally, let the answer be an irreducible fraction P / Q, then you have to output $$P \\cdot Q^{-1} \\bmod (10^9 + 7)$$. It is guaranteed that Q is not divisible by 109 + 7.\n\n## Constraints\nTime limit per test: 2.0 seconds\nMemory limit per test: 256.0 megabytes\n\n## Input Format\nThe first line contains the number of test cases T (1 ≤ T ≤ 1000).\n\nEach of the next T lines contains two integers n and k (1 ≤ k ≤ n ≤ 5·108).\n\n## Output Format\nFor each test case output the answer in a separate line.\n\n## Examples\n```input\n3\n1 1\n2 1\n3 2\n```\n```output\n2\n500000007\n777777786\n```\n\n## Note\nIn the first case the robot will repeatedly search in the only spot. The expected number of days in this case is 2. Note that in spite of the fact that we know the treasure spot from the start, the robot still has to search there until he succesfully recovers the treasure.\n\nIn the second case the answer can be shown to be equal to 7 / 2 if we search the two spots alternatively. In the third case the answer is 25 / 9.\n\n## Editorial\nLet ai, j be the number of times we have checked spot j after i days. Assuming that the spot j contains the treasure, we can see that the expected number of days to find the treasure is $$\\sum_{i=0}^{\\infty} 2^{-a_{i,j}}$$. Hence the unconditional expectation of the answer is $$\\frac{1}{n} \\sum_{i=0}^{\\infty} \\sum_{j=0}^{n-1} 2^{-a_{i,j}}$$. This formula implies that the optimal strategy is to keep the visiting frequencies for all spots as close as possible, since the sum $$\\sum_{j=0}^{n-1} 2^{-a_{i,j}}$$ is minimized under $$\\sum_{j=0}^{n-1} a_{i,j} = ik$$ when ai, j is the smoothest partition of ik. One implementation of this strategy is to visit spots $${ i k } \\operatorname { m o d } n, ( i k + 1 ) \\operatorname { m o d } n, \\ldots, ( i k + k - 1 ) \\operatorname { m o d } n$$ on day i. Note further that this strategy always visits spots in batches of size $$\\gcd(n,k)$$, hence we can divide both n and k by their GCD.\nLet us now consider an example of n = 8, k = 3. Let Ei be the expected number of days to find the treasure in spot i according to the optimal strategy above. We can see that E3 = E0 + 1, E4 = E1 + 1, ..., E7 = E4 + 1, because a cell j + k is visited on day i iff the cell j was visited on day i - 1. We also have E0 = E5 / 2 + 1 for the same reason except for that the cell 0 was visited on the first day. This argument allows to express, say, E0 as a linear expression of itself, and find the answer in O(n) time. Another approach is to substitute the expressions until we cross the end of the sequence once: E0 = E3 - 1 = E6 - 2 = 2E1 - 4, also E1 = 2E2 - 4, but E2 = E5 - 1 = 2E0 - 3. We have obtained a similar set of linear relations of three spots with difference 2. To reduce to n = 3, k = 2 let us group Ej by $$j \\bmod k$$: E0 + E3 + E6 = 3E0 + 3, E1 + E4 + E7 = 3E1 + 3, E2 + E5 = 2E2 + 1. We can see that the total contribution of all Ej for $$j \\equiv x \\pmod{k}$$ is a linear function in Ex, with coefficients depending on whether $$x \\leq n \\bmod k$$. The main idea is that we continue this process with a different set of linear equations, effectively obtaining Euclid's algorithm that stores some additional data.\nLet us now describe the general solution. Assume that we have a set of variables X0, ..., Xn - 1 satisfying Xi + k = A(Xi) for i + k < n, and Xi + k - n = B(Xi) for i + k ≥ n. Assume further that the answer $$E = \\sum_{j=0}^{k-1} S_1(X_j) + \\sum_{j=k}^{n-1} S_2(X_j)$$. Let $$k^{\\prime} = n \\bmod k$$. For j < k', by applying relations A and B successively we obtain $$X_{j+k-k'} = B(A^{\\left\\lfloor n/k \\right\\rfloor}(X_j))$$, hence $$X_{j+k'-k} = A^{-\\left\\lfloor n/k \\right\\rfloor}(B^{-1}(X_j))$$ for j + k' ≥ k. Similarly, $$X_{j+k'} = A^{-\\left\\lfloor n/k-1 \\right\\rfloor} (B^{-1}(X_j))$$ for j + k' < k. Also, $$E = \\sum_{j=0}^{k'-1} S_1'(X_j) + \\sum_{j=k'}^{k-1} S_2'(X_j)$$, where $$S_1' = S_1 + \\sum_{t=1}^{\\left\\lfloor n/k \\right\\rfloor} S_2(A^t)$$, $${ S } _ { 2 } ^ { \\prime } = { S } _ { 1 } + \\sum _ { t = 1 } ^ { \\left[ n / k - 1 \\right] } { S } _ { 2 } ( A ^ { t } )$$. It follows that the transformation n → k, k → k', $$A \\to A^{-\\left\\lfloor n/k-1 \\right\\rfloor}(B^{-1}(X_j))$$, $$B \\rightarrow A^{-\\left[\\frac{n}{k}\\right]}(B^{-1}(X_{j}))$$, S1 → S'1, S2 → S'2 produces the same answer E.\nIn the end of this process we have n = 1, k = 0, hence we have a linear equation X0 = A(X0). After finding X0, the answer is S2(X0). The number of reductions of the above type is $${\\mathcal {O}}(\\log n)$$, with each transformation possible to do in $$O(\\log(n/k))$$ time, (S1 → S'1 and S2 → S'2 require fast matrix exponentation). The total number of operations is $${\\mathcal {O}}(\\log n)$$ per test.\n",

Note that users $$$1$$$ and $$$2$$$, as well as users $$$2$$$ and $$$3$$$, do not form a match, as there is no activity that users $$$1$$$ or $$$3$$$ like, and user $$$2$$$ doesn't like.\n\n## Editorial\nAfter formalizing the statement, we get the following:\nGiven $$$n$$$ sets $$$S_1, S_2, \\ldots, S_n$$$ of activities, find a pair $$$(a, b)$$$ such that all three sets $$$S_a \\setminus S_b, S_b \\setminus S_a, S_a \\cap S_b$$$ are non-empty.\nIn essence, this means that for a pair $$$(a, b)$$$ to not be good, it must suffice that $$$S_a$$$ and $$$S_b$$$ are either disjoint or one included in the other. Consequently, it means that, if there are no such good pairs, then the sets must induce a tree structure! In this structure, some vertex $$$u$$$ is an ancestor of vertex $$$v$$$ if and only if $$$S_v \\subseteq S_u$$$.\nThe solution now can be summarized by the following idea: try to construct the tree (assuming there are no good pairs), and check for errors along the process (this will, in fact, expose a good pair). There are multiple ways of achieving that, both top-down and bottom-up (and they are more or less equivalent). We will describe a solution based on a top-down approach.\nTop down approach. Let's start by sort the activity sets in decreasing order of lengths. For all activity sets $$$S_i$$$ in this order, we will create a parent-child relationship $$$j = p(i)$$$ with the last processed index $$$j$$$ that contains some activity (or $$$-1$$$, if there is no such index). The activity based on which we choose $$$j$$$ is not relevant, for reasons that will be apparent as follows. After finding such $$$j$$$ (or deciding that $$$j = -1$$$), we have some cases to consider:\n1. If $$$j \\neq -1$$$ and $$$S_i \\not\\subseteq S_j$$$, then $$$(i, j)$$$ is a good pair, as $$$S_j$$$ cannot possibly include $$$S_i$$$ due to the length of $$$S_j$$$ being at least as much as $$$S_i$$$.\n2. If some activity $$$x \\in S_i$$$ is also in some other set $$$S_k$$$ where $$$p(k) = p(i)$$$, then $$$(i, k)$$$ is a good pair.\n3. Otherwise, the activity sets still form a tree, therefore no good pairs exist (yet).\nComplexity is $$$\\mathcal{O}(k \\log k)$$$ or $$$\\mathcal{O}(k)$$$, where $$$k$$$ is the total number of activities, depending on whether one uses ordered sets or hash maps. It is possible to implement this solution in $$$\\mathcal{O}(k)$$$ using just arrays, but this is not required.\nAlternative approach. One may solve this problem without leveraging the tree structure of the activity sets. It stems from the observation that any good pair $$$(a, b)$$$ must have a common element $$$x$$$. Let's fix all such $$$x$$$, and sort the sets having $$$x$$$ as an element in the order of length. Then, similarly to the first solution, one may prove that it is sufficient that a set with a smaller length has an element not present in some set with a larger length. We can solve this by simply keeping an array which keeps track of existing elements present in the sets, and iterating from right to left.\nThis approach does not quite work yet, as it has quadratic complexity; however, by considering the sets with large size (i.e., larger than $$$\\sqrt{k}$$$) separately than the elements with a small size (i.e. smaller than $$$\\sqrt{k}$$$), then one may achieve $$$\\mathcal{O}(k \\sqrt{k})$$$ complexity using this approach.\n",

      "output": "To solve this problem, we need to guess a hidden number \\( x \\) between 1 and \\( M = 10004205361450474 \\) using up to 5 queries. Each query involves sending an increasing sequence of integers, and based on the response, we can narrow down the possible range for \\( x \\). The challenge is to structure these queries optimally to cover the maximum possible range each time.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Dynamic Programming (DP) Approach**: We use a DP table to precompute the maximum interval that can be covered with a given number of remaining queries. The DP state `dp(l, q)` represents the maximum interval length starting from `l` that can be covered with `q` queries remaining.\n2. **Memoization**: The DP values are memoized to avoid redundant calculations. For large values of `l` (greater than 10,000), we use the same value as for `l = 10,000` to optimize memory usage.\n3. **Query Generation**: For each query, we generate a sequence of integers based on the precomputed DP values. This sequence is designed to split the possible range of `x` into intervals that can be efficiently checked with the remaining queries.\n4. **Interactive Response Handling**: Based on the response to each query, we adjust the current interval to narrow down the possible range for `x`.\n\n### Solution Code\n```cpp\n#include <bits/stdc++.h>\nusing namespace std;\n\ntypedef long long ll;\n\nconst int MAX_L = 10000;\nconst int MAX_Q = 5;\nconst ll M = 10004205361450474LL;\n\nll memo[MAX_L + 1][MAX_Q + 1];\n\nll dp(int l, int q) {\n    if (l > MAX_L) return dp(MAX_L, q);\n    if (memo[l][q] != -1) return memo[l][q];\n    if (q == 0) return memo[l][q] = 0;\n    ll current = l;\n    int k_max = min(l, 10000);\n    for (int i = 0; i < k_max; ++i) {\n        ll step = dp(current, q - 1);\n        current += step + 1;\n        if (current > M) break;\n    }\n    ll res = current - l + dp(current, q - 1);\n    res = min(res, M - l + 1);\n    return memo[l][q] = res;\n}\n\nvector<ll> build_query(ll low, int q) {\n    vector<ll> s;\n    ll l = (low > MAX_L) ?

If the response indicates `x` is in a specific interval, the lower and upper bounds are updated accordingly.\n4. **Efficiency**: The use of memoization ensures that the DP values are computed efficiently, and the handling of large values of `l` by using `l = 10,000` optimizes memory usage.\n\nThis approach ensures that we efficiently narrow down the possible range for `x` using the minimum number of queries, leveraging dynamic programming and memoization for optimal performance.",
