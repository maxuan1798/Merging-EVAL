    "output": "To determine how many 9-digit numbers exist in the decimal system that are divisible by 11 and in which every digit from 1 to 9 occurs exactly once, we need to consider the following steps:\n\n1. **Divisibility by 11**: A number is divisible by 11 if the alternating sum of its digits (S_odd - S_even) is a multiple of 11. For a 9-digit number, S_odd is the sum of the digits in the odd positions (1, 3, 5, 7, 9) and S_even is the sum of the digits in the even positions (2, 4, 6, 8).\n\n2. **Total Sum of Digits**: The sum of all digits from 1 to 9 is 45. Therefore, S_odd + S_even = 45 and S_odd - S_even ≡ 0 (mod 11).\n\n3. **Solving for S_odd and S_even**:\n   - Adding the equations: 2S_odd ≡ 45 (mod 11) → 2S_odd ≡ 1 (mod 11).\n   - The modular inverse of 2 modulo 11 is 6, so S_odd ≡ 6 (mod 11).\n   - Possible values of S_odd within the range [15, 35] are 17 and 28.\n\n4. **Counting Valid Subsets**:\n   - We need to find the number of 5-element subsets of {1, ..., 9} that sum to 17 or 28.\n   - Using complementarity, the number of 5-element subsets summing to 17 is equal to the number of 4-element subsets summing to 28, and vice versa.\n   - The number of 4-element subsets summing to 17 is 9, and the number of 4-element subsets summing to 28 is 2.\n\n5. **Calculating Permutations**:\n   - For each valid subset, the 5 digits can be arranged in 5! ways in the odd positions, and the remaining 4 digits can be arranged in 4! ways in the even positions.\n   - Total permutations: (9 + 2) * 5! * 4! = 11 * 120 * 24 = 31680.\n\nThus, the number of such 9-digit numbers is \\(\\boxed{31680}\\).",
