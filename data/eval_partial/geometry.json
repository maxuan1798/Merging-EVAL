    "output": "To determine the largest possible number of interior angles greater than \\(180^\\circ\\) in an \\(n\\)-gon with all sides of equal length and no self-intersections, we start by considering the properties of simple polygons. \n\n1. **Sum of Interior Angles**: The sum of the interior angles of an \\(n\\)-gon is \\((n-2) \\cdot 180^\\circ\\).\n2. **Reflex and Convex Angles**: Reflex angles are greater than \\(180^\\circ\\), while convex angles are less than \\(180^\\circ\\). If there are \\(k\\) reflex angles, the remaining \\(n - k\\) angles are convex.\n3. **Balancing the Sum**: Let the reflex angles be \\(180^\\circ + \\epsilon_i\\) (where \\(\\epsilon_i > 0\\)) and the convex angles be \\(180^\\circ - \\delta_j\\) (where \\(\\delta_j > 0\\)).

This is derived from the requirement that the sum of the positive exterior angles (convex vertices) must compensate for the negative exterior angles (reflex vertices) to maintain the total sum of \\(360^\\circ\\).\n\nThus, the largest possible number of interior angles greater than \\(180^\\circ\\) in an equilateral \\(n\\)-gon that does not intersect itself is \\(\\boxed{n - 3}\\).",

The vertex of this quadratic function, which opens upwards, occurs at \\(x = \\frac{3}{8}\\). Substituting \\(x = \\frac{3}{8}\\) into the function, we find the minimum value of the modulus squared to be \\(\\frac{7}{8}\\). Taking the square root gives the minimum modulus:\n\n\\[\n\\sqrt{\\frac{7}{8}} = \\frac{\\sqrt{14}}{4}\n\\]\n\nThus, the minimum value of \\(|z^2 - z + 2|\\) is \\(\\boxed{\\dfrac{\\sqrt{14}}{4}}\\).",

The radius of the Earth is given as 6371 km.\n\n1. **Calculate the distances from the Earth's center:**\n   - Perigee distance: \\(6371 \\, \\text{km} + 200 \\, \\text{km} = 6571 \\, \\text{km}\\)\n   - Apogee distance: \\(6371 \\, \\text{km} + 350 \\, \\text{km} = 6721 \\, \\text{km}\\)\n\n2. **Determine the viewing angle formula:**\n   - The viewing angle from a point on the orbit is the angle subtended by the Earth at that point. This angle can be calculated using the formula for the angle between two tangents from an external point to a circle: \\(2 \\arcsin \\left( \\frac{r}{d} \\right)\\), where \\(r\\) is the Earth's radius and \\(d\\) is the distance from the point to the Earth's center.\n\n3. **Calculate the maximum viewing angle:**\n   - The maximum viewing angle occurs at the closest point (perigee) because the angle is inversely proportional to the distance.

The key property of a BSP tree is that any straight line will intersect at most \\(O(\\log n)\\) regions, where \\(n\\) is the number of regions. \n\nFor \\(n = 1,000,000\\), the depth of a balanced BSP tree is approximately \\(\\log_2(1,000,000) \\approx 20\\).

Determine the ratio of the areas of triangles $AMP$ and $ABC$ as a function of $k = BD : BC$.\n\n---\n\nTranslate the above text into English, preserving the original text's line breaks and formatting. Directly output the translation result.\n\nOkay, let me work through this problem step by step. We have an isosceles triangle \\(ABC\\) with base \\(BC\\), where \\(F\\) is the midpoint of \\(BC\\). A point \\(D\\) is on segment \\(BF\\). A perpendicular from \\(D\\) to \\(BC\\) intersects \\(AB\\) at \\(M\\), and a line through \\(D\\) parallel to \\(AB\\) intersects \\(AC\\) at \\(P\\). We need to find the ratio \\(\\frac{\\text{Area of } \\triangle AMP}{\\text{Area of } \\triangle ABC}\\) as a function of \\(k = \\frac{BD}{BC}\\).\n\nFirst, I'll assign coordinates to the triangle for clarity. Let’s place \\(B\\) at \\((0, 0)\\), \\(C\\) at \\((2c, 0)\\), making \\(F\\) the midpoint at \\((c, 0)\\). Since \\(ABC\\) is isosceles with base \\(BC\\), vertex \\(A\\) must be at \\((c, h)\\), where \\(h\\) is the height of the triangle.\n\nPoint \\(D\\) lies on \\(BF\\). Given \\(k = \\frac{BD}{BC}\\), \\(BD = k \\cdot BC = 2kc\\). Since \\(BC = 2c\\), \\(D\\) is at \\((2kc, 0)\\).\n\nNext, the perpendicular from \\(D\\) to \\(BC\\) is a vertical line \\(x = 2kc\\). This intersects \\(AB\\), whose equation is \\(y = \\frac{h}{c}x\\). Substituting \\(x = 2kc\\), we find \\(M\\) at \\((2kc, 2kh)\\).\n\nThe line through \\(D\\) parallel to \\(AB\\) has the same slope \\(\\frac{h}{c}\\). Its equation is \\(y = \\frac{h}{c}(x - 2kc)\\). To find \\(P\\), we intersect this line with \\(AC\\), whose equation is \\(y = -\\frac{h}{c}x + 2h\\). Solving these equations:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{h}{c}(x - 2kc) = -\\frac{h}{c}x + 2h\n\\]\n\nSimplifying gives \\(x = c(1 + k)\\) and \\(y = h(1 - k)\\), so \\(P\\) is at \\((c(1 + k), h(1 - k))\\).\n\nNow, using coordinates \\(A(c, h)\\), \\(M(2kc, 2kh)\\), and \\(P(c(1 + k), h(1 - k))\\), we apply the shoelace formula to compute the area of \\(\\triangle AMP\\):\n\n\\[\n\\text{Area} = \\frac{1}{2} \\left| c(2kh - h(1 - k)) + 2kc(h(1 - k) - h) + c(1 + k)(h - 2kh) \\right|\n\\]\n\nSimplifying each term and combining:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Area of } \\triangle AMP = ch(k - 2k^2)\n\\]\n\nSince the area of \\(\\triangle ABC\\) is \\(ch\\), the ratio is:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{\\text{Area of } \\triangle AMP}{\\text{Area of } \\triangle ABC} = k - 2k^2 = k(1 - 2k)\n\\]\n\nThus, the final answer is \\(\\boxed{k(1 - 2k)}\\).",
