This means that there is no more than one counterfeit coin in it. Divide it into two piles of 10 coins and weigh them. If the scales are in balance, then all 20 weighed coins are genuine. If one of the pans outweighs, then there are 10 genuine coins on that pan, and among the other 10 coins, there is exactly one counterfeit. Divide these 10 coins into three piles of 4, 4, and 2 coins. In the third weighing, compare the two piles of 4 coins. If they balance, then all 8 coins are genuine and we have found 18 genuine coins. If one of the piles outweighs, then there are 4 genuine coins in it, the other pile contains the counterfeit coin, and the 2 set aside coins are genuine. In total, 16 genuine coins have been found.",
    "output": "The problem involves identifying genuine coins among 40 coins where the number of counterfeit coins is odd. The solution uses three weighings to determine the genuine coins. Here is the step-by-step reasoning:\n\n1. **First Weighing**: Divide the 40 coins into two groups of 20 each and weigh them. Since the number of counterfeit coins is odd, one group will be heavier. This heavier group contains at most one more counterfeit coin than the lighter group.\n2. **Second Weighing**: Take the heavier group of 20 coins and divide it into two groups of 10 coins each. Weigh these two groups. \n   - If they balance, all 20 coins from the first weighing are genuine, but this is only possible if the counterfeit coins are distributed such that each group of 10 has the same number of counterfeit coins. However, this step might not always be accurate if there are more than one counterfeit coins.\n   - If they do not balance, the heavier group of 10 coins contains the counterfeit coins.\n3. **Third Weighing**: Take the heavier group of 10 coins and divide it into three piles: 4, 4, and 2 coins. Weigh the two piles of 4 coins each.\n   - If they balance, all 8 coins are genuine, and the 2 coins set aside are also genuine, resulting in 18 genuine coins.\n   - If they do not balance, the heavier pile of 4 coins contains the counterfeit coins, and the other 4 coins and the 2 coins set aside are genuine, resulting in 16 genuine coins.\n\nThe solution guarantees finding at least 16 genuine coins, as the worst-case scenario from the third weighing results in 16 genuine coins. Therefore, the final answer is:\n\n\\boxed{16}",

The current player can always take 1 stone (a factor of any number), leaving an odd number, which is a losing position.\n- Odd numbers are losing positions. Any factor of an odd number (excluding itself) is odd, and subtracting an odd number from an odd number results in an even number, which is a winning position for the opponent.\n\nThus, all odd numbers between 2 and 99 are losing positions. Counting the odd numbers in this range:\n- The odd numbers start from 3 and go up to 99.\n- The number of terms in the sequence \\( 3, 5, 7, \\ldots, 99 \\) is calculated as follows:\n  - The first term \\( a_1 = 3 \\)\n  - The last term \\( a_n = 99 \\)\n  - The common difference \\( d = 2 \\)\n  - The number of terms \\( n \\) is given by \\( a_n = a_1 + (n - 1)d \\):\n    \\[\n    99 = 3 + (n - 1) \\times 2 \\implies 99 = 3 + 2n - 2 \\implies 99 = 2n + 1 \\implies 2n = 98 \\implies n = 49\n    \\]\n\nTherefore, there are 49 odd numbers between 3 and 99, inclusive.

This implies that the maximum number of candies that can be taken without having any type with exactly 10 candies must be less than 145.\n2. **Pigeonhole Principle**: If we denote \\( T \\) as the total number of candies not in types with exactly 10 candies, and \\( k \\) as the number of types with exactly 10 candies, then the maximum number of candies that can be taken without having any type with exactly 10 candies is \\( T + 9k \\).

A triangle-saturated graph (or maximal triangle-free graph) is one where adding any missing edge will create a triangle.\n\nKey steps and reasoning:\n1. **Definition of Saturation**: A graph is triangle-saturated if it is triangle-free and adding any edge creates a triangle.\n2. **Star Graph Consideration**: A star graph, where one central vertex is connected to all other vertices, is triangle-free. Adding any edge between two leaves (vertices connected only to the center) forms a triangle with the center.\n3. **Edge Count in Star Graph**: For \\( n \\) vertices, a star graph has \\( n - 1 \\) edges.
